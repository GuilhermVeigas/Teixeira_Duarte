Successful workers in the dynamic and uncertain landscape of the workplace of the future will need to adapt rapidly to changing job demands, highlighting the necessity for lifelong learning and development. With few exceptions, industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists have tended to take an organization-centered perspective on training and development; a perspective that promotes worker development as a means to organizational success. Hence, we call for a broadening of this view to include a person-centered perspective on workplace learning focused on individual skill development. A person-centered perspective addresses lifelong learning and skill development for those already in the labor force, whether they are working within or outside of organizations (e.g., gig workers), or those looking for work. It includes the most vulnerable people currently working or seeking work. We describe the factors affecting the future of work, the need to incorporate a person-centered perspective on work-related skill learning into I-O research and practice, and highlight several areas for future research and practice.  © The Author(s), 2025.

As remote work and flexible schedules become more prevalent, organizations much continuously refine their strategies for enhancing employee engagement through captivating experiences. Employee engagement and employee experience are inter- related but two different constructs. Employee experience (EX) is an employee- centric bottom- up approach to understanding how employees experience and perceive work, workplace, and management practices. This chapter deepens our understanding of employee experience (EX), and why organizations are transitioning from traditional employee engagement strategies to EX approach. The chapter highlights the critical role of employee experience management (EXM), its use cases throughout the employee life cycle, its benefits, challenges and the role of managers in creating positive EX in the workplace.

The reference situation is the COVID-19 crisis, seen as a case study. To describe the process as accurately as possible and to identify areas of diligence, we use a mixed method based on 51 questionnaires containing numerous open-ended questions and eight semi-structured interviews. The descriptive part of our analysis allows us to focus on the link between the degree of experience and the proactivity of newcomers. It also reveals the differing expectations that newcomers may have regarding what integration should entail. Applying methods from grounded theory, we identify five key areas for companies wishing to effectively integrate their collaborators. The article concludes with the need for companies to return to implementing integration tactics and devices and make the process less dependent on employee proactivity. To continue, it seems crucial to focus on further research for a better understanding of what each individual expects from integration, particularly when new generations are concerned. Implications for Central European audience: In today’s fast-changing environment, swift integration of new employees is increasingly becoming a key success factor. However, the rapid growth of remote activities within companies presents a new constraint that must be considered. Additionally, it is essential to recognize that newer generations may perceive the integration process itself differently or may be less willing to invest effort in it.

In large-scale robotic process automation (RPA), managing quantities of tasks executed by software robots that run 24/7 is critical. It calls for an end-to-end solution comprising planned schedules, service level agreement (SLA) compliance, server capacities, and system outage avoidance strategies. This paper proposes a new business-driven data model for RPA monitoring to enhance the evaluation and maintenance of software robots in 24/7 environments. The literature review confirmed a lack of flexible data models for RPA monitoring with a business orientation, particularly in big environments. The business-driven data model contains three domains, 13 enumerations, seven entities, and 116 attributes for enabling seamless robot task execution. The quality is measured against five established criteria related to data models. Moreover, the Center of Excellence (CoE) applies the business-driven data model in a Shared Service Center (SSC). The CoE manages over 170 robotized tasks, ensuring efficient operations. This research increases the monitoring and assessment of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to work effectively and efficiently with software robots. By embracing an enterprise-focused data model, organizations can align RPA initiatives more effectively with business objectives, enhance system visibility, and make more informed decisions. © 2013 IEEE."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:15:38"",""2025-11-23 13:15:38"","""",""169929-169952"","""","""",""13"","""",""IEEE Access"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""","""","""","""",""Center of excellence; data model; data model quality; monitoring; robotic process automation; software robots"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Design/methodology/approach: We take a conceptual approach and present our perspective on what we see as the most critical trends shaping PM and talent management. Contingency theory and Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity (VUCA) theory provide a sound theoretical framework for understanding and responding to the complex and rapidly changing business context post-COVID-19. Findings: Drawing on these theories, we create a framework providing a means of understanding why and how MNCs can maintain talent and, at the same time, develop new talent through the PM process. Practical implications: Importantly, our study emphasizes the critical role that project management and talent management techniques play for both practitioners and scholars. In order to gain and sustain a competitive edge in the ever-changing VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) landscape, these processes necessitate ongoing reassessment and adaptation.

While previous research has examined the connections between professional isolation (PI), OC, WFB, and JS separately in the context of teleworking, this research proposes an integrative model examining the connections between all these work-related constructs and allowing for mediating and moderating effects. It focuses on IT employees in the technological industry forced to telework, a setting underexamined by previous literature. The final sample is composed of 294 teleworkers forced to work partly at home by their companies. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied, and SmartPLS 4.0.8.7 software was used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Our results indicate a positive and significant direct effect of WFB on JS and OC, a negative and significant effect of PI on JS and OC, and a positive and significant effect of JS on OC. Our results also indicate that JS mediates the relationship between WFB and OC and between PI and OC and that neither time spent teleworking nor gender moderates the association between PI and OC. Overall, our results suggest that while PI negatively affects OC, JS, and WFB are the most relevant determinants of OC in the context of teleworking. In addition, a complementary IPMA analysis reinforces this view by suggesting that WFB and JS are the most important factors in determining OC performance among IT employees working from home, while PI is not important. The originality of this article is the proposal of an integrative model examining the connections between JS, WFB, PI, and OC and allowing for mediating (JS) and moderating (gender and percentage of time teleworking) effects from a talent management perspective. Moreover, this study focuses on information technology companies and the situation of forced remote working, two settings that have been underexamined. The results could help companies with forced teleworking develop effective strategies to attract, develop, and retain top talent in the information technology industry in the post-pandemic era.

These include limited digital connectivity, lack of access to technological devices, insufficient inclusive pedagogical strategies among educators, and disparities rooted in ethnicity, gender, language, social class, culture, and disability—factors especially prevalent in marginalized areas. As a result, access to virtual distance education remains limited for many students. This study aims to identify the primary barriers affecting accessibility and usability in digital inclusion. The study employed a qualitative methodology based on a literature review of academic research published between 2020 and 2025. Selection criteria included relevance, coherence, and quality of information, drawing from academic databases such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, Springer, SciELO, and ERIC. The findings reveal several recurring barriers: technological inequality, low digital literacy and usability, limited integration of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) in virtual pedagogy, and insufficient teacher training in inclusive strategies for online learning. However, the literature also highlights key opportunities, such as the expansion of virtual education, the use of assistive technologies, personalized learning, improved access in geographically isolated regions, and the implementation of inclusive educational policies. This analysis underscores that achieving full virtual inclusion requires an integrated approach—one that combines digital innovation, continuous teacher training, and public policies that ensure equitable access and equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their diverse backgrounds. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026."",""2026"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"","""",""35-47"","""","""",""1678 LNNS"","""","""",""Virtual Inclusion in Distance Education"","""","""","""","""",""Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

This exclusion is compounded by low digital literacy, sporadic earnings, and persistent reliance on cash transactions—particularly in Odisha, where the informal sector dominates urban employment. As a result, financial institutions struggle to extend inclusive services such as credit and insurance to these underserved communities. To address this challenge, we propose a generative AI framework based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to simulate realistic financial behaviors from limited vendor data. Trained on transaction data from 1000 urban vendors, our model generates synthetic profiles conditioned on socio-demographic attributes, achieving high fidelity (Fréchet distance = 10.12) and behavioral diversity (entropy = 3.59 bits). Augmenting real-world datasets with these synthetic records improves loan-default prediction by 3.2% and anomaly detection by 2.9%. The framework incorporates fairness-aware training, maintains demographic parity (deviation < 2.4%), and has been validated through stakeholder engagement. These results show that responsibly applied generative AI can enhance data equity and foster inclusive digital finance in low-resource settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"","""",""653-677"","""",""4"",""7"","""",""Digit Finance"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Springer International Publishing"","""","""","""","""",""Digital financial modeling; Fairness auditing; FinTech inclusion; Generative adversarial networks; Informal economy; Socio-technical validation; Street vendors; Synthetic financial data"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Conducted between November 2023 and June 2024, the study applied thematic analysis based on Oliver and Foscarini’s (2020) recordkeeping culture framework to explore organizational readiness, technological infrastructure, and healthcare professionals' skills in managing electronic records. Results: The findings reveal significant differences in EMR adoption between the islands. Hospitals on Java exhibited proactive engagement, supported by better technological infrastructure and staff training programs, while Sulawesi hospitals adopted EMRs primarily to meet regulatory requirements. Challenges included inconsistent internet connectivity, low digital literacy among staff, and ongoing reliance on paper records during the transition. Some Java hospitals have begun fostering a culture conducive to electronic recordkeeping by focusing on developing staff skills in EMR management. Conclusions: The effectiveness of EMR adoption in Indonesia relies on addressing technological infrastructure issues and enhancing staff digital literacy. While progress has been made, particularly in more developed regions, a cohesive national strategy emphasizing technological support and targeted training is essential to fully realize the benefits of EMRs in improving healthcare and recordkeeping standards across Indonesia. © The Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"","""","""","""",""1"",""25"","""",""BMC Health Serv.

Digital health tools, such as remote patient monitoring (RPM), have significant potential to address these healthcare challenges, yet there is little research on the facilitators and barriers of RPM in these regions. Aim: This study aims to identify and understand the facilitators and barriers healthcare staff face implementing RPM in rural and regional Australia, with focus on challenges that arose after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with healthcare professionals from publicly funded health services in western rural and regional Victoria, Australia. An open-ended interview guide based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify key themes and strategies for effective RPM implementation. The analysis considered barriers and facilitators at micro, meso, and macro levels. Results: Several barriers to RPM implementation were identified across different levels: (1) Micro-Level Factors, such as perceived low digital literacy and language barriers among individuals; (2) Meso-Level Factors, including disparities in IT infrastructure and device availability, limited training opportunities, and the need for enhanced governance within healthcare settings; and (3) Macro-Level Factors, encompassing evolving funding models and the reliability of service providers. Despite these challenges, participants acknowledged potential benefits such as improved technological interoperability, enhanced community engagement, and a data-driven approach to quality improvement. Importantly, a flexible, tailored RPM approach to accommodate specific rural and regional needs was deemed valuable. Conclusion: Effective RPM deployment in rural and regional areas is viewed by health professionals as crucial for bridging healthcare divides. However, if strategies developed for urban settings are not recalibrated to address rural challenges, the risk of RPM failure may escalate. Future initiatives must prioritize region-specific strategies and policy reforms aimed at ensuring equitable digital infrastructure and financial resource allocation to enhance healthcar"	e access in rural and regional settings. This approach may ensure that RPM solutions are both	adaptable	and effective, tailored to the unique needs	of each community. © The	"Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23"	1	03:19:03	""",""2"	-25	11	-2	3 13:1	09:00	"3"","""""	","""","""""	","""	"1"","	"""25"","""",""B"	MC	Health	Serv.

This study examines the nature and consequences of digital exclusion through a localized quantitative assessment, framed within Van Dijk’s Model of the Digital Divide and Sen’s Capability Approach. A structured survey of 200 residents yielded 65 valid responses, revealing stark disparities: 52.3% lacked internet access, 38.5% cited affordability as a primary constraint, and 66.2% reported insufficient digital skills. Analytical methods included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, regression modeling, and effect size measurements (Cohen’s d). Results identified cost, connectivity gaps, and geographic isolation as dominant predictors of exclusion, with affordability exerting the strongest influence. Digital exclusion adversely affects access to education, healthcare information, and economic participation, especially for youth and women. The study proposes a multi-tiered intervention framework that includes, broadband infrastructure expansion; targeted affordability measures such as subsidized device acquisition, zero-rating of mobile data and community-centric digital literacy initiatives and; the adoption of AI-enabled offline tools. The study aligns with global calls for digital equity and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 1, 4, 8, 10, and 16. By responding to the lived realities of rural communities, this research contributes to the broader discourse on inclusive digital transformation and highlights the importance of stakeholder collaboration to address structural inequities, ensuring rural populations are not further marginalized in an increasingly connected world. © The Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"","""","""","""",""1"",""3"","""",""Discov.

The authors searched six databases for literature examining the use of technology to support treatment among lung cancer patients. Twenty-three papers were included. We mapped each technology, telehealth platforms, online portals, and mobile apps, to specific treatment phases (pre-treatment, active treatment, post-treatment) and symptom domains (symptom management (N = 17), emotional distress (N = 12), and patient–provider communication (N = 7)). Our results demonstrate that technology can effectively alleviate treatment-related symptoms, reduce emotional burden, and enhance communication. Key barriers included low digital literacy and limited device access.

In Israel, where society is already polarized, exposure to misinformation could exacerbate existing tensions between the ultra-orthodox (Haredi) and the general population. Furthermore, the low digital literacy of the Haredi population presumably makes them more vulnerable to the influence of misinformation. This study compared the ability of Haredi and non-Haredi Jews to detect misinformation, while examining the relationship between misinformation detection and digital literacy and knowledge. 83 Jewish participants (Haredi and non-Haredi) evaluated the credibility of online news articles. Eye tracking technology was used to examine participants’ scan patterns and attention to information metadata. The results showed that Haredi participants were less successful in identifying false messages and less attentive to metadata. However, when combined with other predictors in multivariate regression, Haredi became a non-significant predictor, and digital knowledge and activity on social networks were found to be significant and strong predictors of misinformation identification. In terms of digital literacy, while there was no difference in subjective assessment, the study found a significant gap between the two populations in terms of psychophysiological behavioral indices (i.e., scan patterns) and digital knowledge. The implications of such dramatic differences in skills and the vulnerability to false messages of a secluded, disadvantaged population, as well as the need to invest resources to increase digital literacy among the Haredi population to reduce these gaps, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"",""2025-11-23 13:19:03"","""","""","""",""1"",""12"","""",""Hum.

Recent decades have seen global advancements in E-government, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This study assesses E-government development of 10 ASEAN countries and their global standings. It relies on data from the United Nations E-government Survey (2014–2024), and the key performance metrics of E-government progression include the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and the E-participation Index (EPI). The findings reveal that the EGDI of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam has significantly improved over the past decade, while Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar have achieved moderate gains in EGDI. Additionally, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand have made significant progress in EPI during the same period, while most ASEAN countries have achieved moderate improvements in citizen engagement. The common E-government challenges facing most countries in the ASEAN bloc are inadequate internet access, low digital literacy, digital divides, and public distrust in digital platforms. Policymakers must prioritize investments in digital infrastructure to expand broadband access and bridge urban-rural divides. Additionally, resources should be allocated for enhancing digital literacy through educational initiatives. Moreover, updated cybersecurity and data protection laws are essential to fostering public trust in digital platforms.

Technology-supported interventions, such as wearables, mobile applications, and web-based platforms, have emerged as effective tools to promote PA. However, engagement with technology alone is not sufficient. Effectiveness depends on whether digital tools foster sustained adherence to prescribed PA, since health benefits are dose-dependent on activity levels. In this sense, adherence matters not just for short-term participation but for embedding long-term behaviour change, an especially pressing challenge for older adults, who are typically less active and may experience greater barriers to digital engagement. This scoping review aimed to identify psychological and motivational factors that influence adherence to both the physical activity component and the supporting technology. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) for studies published between 2000 and March 2023. Fifty-three studies were included, encompassing qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods designs. Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) were identified and categorised using the BCT Taxonomy v1, distinguishing between techniques delivered via technology and those delivered through human interaction. Data were synthesised, distinguishing between adherence to physical activity and adherence to technology use. Results: Frequently used BCTs included self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning, feedback, prompts/cues, and social support, with different techniques emphasised in digital versus human-facilitated delivery modes. From the qualitative data, 417 psychological and motivational factors were identified and grouped into 25 thematic categories. These were structured into five domains: (1) user factors related to technology adherence, (2) technology-related factors influencing technology adherence, (3) context factors related to technology adherence, (4) user factors related to PA adherence, and (5) context factors related to PA adherence. Key facilitators included ease of use, personalised content, motivational feedback, and social support, while key barriers included low digital literacy, repetitive content, and lack of guidance.

ShePowerChain is a blockchain platform that aims to address these problems with decentralized finance, smart contracts, and verifiable credentials. ShePowerChain’s secure, transparent, and automated transactions not only streamline processes but, depending on modeled scenarios, help reduce wage payment delays by 25% and increase women-led microloan access by 40%. By enabling secure, transparent, and automated transactions, ShePowerChain disintermediates, enhances job verification, and enforces wage fairness. The platform uses zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, multi-factor authentication for security, and Layer 2 scaling solutions for efficiency. While the results were from simulations and comparisons, they were not due to full real world usage. Comparative studies point to its potential to improve financial access, close wage gaps, and establish trust in hiring processes. The design also considers a serious ethical risk of excluding women who have low digital literacy, suggesting digital skills training, and adaptive strategies for community.

This study addresses the research gap by examining the current state, challenges, and ethical considerations of AI adoption in Tanzania’s healthcare system. Combining a systematic literature review with semi-structured interviews involving 32 key stakeholders, including healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and technologists, the study provides a comprehensive, context-sensitive analysis. The findings reveal that AI is increasingly applied to diagnostics, predictive analytics, mental health support, and health education. However, widespread adoption is constrained by infrastructural deficits, organisational readiness gaps, limited workforce capacity, and low digital literacy, particularly in rural areas. Ethical concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and lack of transparency also emerged as critical barriers. Policy fragmentation and the absence of AI-specific implementation guidance further complicate integration efforts. Despite these challenges, stakeholders expressed optimism about AI’s potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce provider burden, and expand access, especially through mobile-based tools. This study’s unique contribution lies in its integration of the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) and Ethical AI frameworks to assess AI adoption holistically, linking global evidence to local realities. The study recommends decentralised policy development, inclusive design processes, and sustained investment in digital infrastructure and training. These actions are essential for fostering ethical, inclusive, and sustainable AI-driven healthcare transformation in Tanzania and similar low-resource settings. © The Author(s) 2025.

Low digital literacy among young individuals also offers an explanation for lower levels of civic engagement. This study explores young people’s perceptions of civic engagement and the effects of disinformation through qualitative focus group discussions. Eight focus groups comprising young adults were conducted to gather insights into their motivations, experiences, and perspectives regarding social and political issues as well as fake news combating strategies. Findings from this research will contribute to the existing literature on the relationship between youth, fake news, and civic engagement. The results indicate that youth primarily rely on social media for information, with Instagram emerging as a key platform for real-time updates. While participants recognise the importance of credible sources, many demonstrated superficial strategies for assessing reliability, such as evaluating the number of followers or brand reputation, which may leave them vulnerable to fake news. This tendency highlights a gap between formal digital literacy education and actual media consumption practices. Ultimately, the findings underscore the critical need for education and awareness to equip young individuals with the tools necessary to discern credible information and engage meaningfully in civic discourse, offering valuable insights for civic NGO communication strategies. © 2025 by the authors."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:22:28"",""2025-11-23 13:22:28"","""","""","""",""3"",""6"","""",""Journal.

For this purpose, a conceptual model consisting of effort expectancy and performance expectancy structures based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and expanded with the digital literacy dimension has been created. Data were collected from 158 participants who were administrative staff of two higher education institutions in Türkiye to evaluate the theoretical model. The data were analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings revealed the relationship between the digital literacy skills of higher education administrative staff and their intention to use digital technology. According to the results, digital literacy has a direct effect on effort expectancy but not on performance expectancy. Also, contrary to our expectations, digital literacy does not directly affect the intention to use. However, digital literacy affects the intention to use digital technology through effort expectancy and performance expectancy. In higher education, personnel with low digital literacy skills should be identified and in-service training should be provided. This is one of the first studies to address the impact of digital literacy on technology acceptance by administrative staff working in higher education. © The Author(s) 2023.

This study aimed to qualitatively explore the perceptions of clinical specialists, and CP patients regarding the feasibility, barriers, and facilitators of home-based telerehabilitation. Methods: This qualitative study conducted a thematic analysis approach. Participants include two groups: 17 medical informatics and rehabilitation professionals and 13 CP patients and/or their caregivers. Participants were selected via expert and snowball sampling. Interviews were semi-structured, transcribed, and analyzed using the Braun-Clarke thematic analysis technique and MAXQDA software. Results: Thematic analysis revealed four dominant themes including feasibility, barriers, facilitators, and advantages. Feasibility was affected by technological infrastructure (internet connectivity, data security), human resources (availability of multidisciplinary specialists), legal aspects (patient data privacy), and financial sustainability. Key barriers included low digital literacy, limited access to specialized rehabilitation technologies, cultural resistance, legal regulations, and financial constraints. The findings also highlighted several advantages of home-based telerehabilitation, including cost savings, improved accessibility to rehabilitation, and enhanced patient engagement in therapy. Conclusion: The current study suggested that home-based telerehabilitation can be a feasible alternative for CP patients in Iran, but a variety of technological, financial, legal, and cultural barriers must first be addressed for its successful development. Overcoming such barriers requires targeted investments, supportive policies, and cultural education for successful implementation. © The Author(s).

The MSME sector contributes 61% to the national gross domestic product and employs almost 97% of the workforce. MSMEs' high labor absorption and relatively low investment capital requirements make MSMEs more flexible and resilient in adjusting to highly dynamic market conditions. However, the sector faces various internal and external obstacles, such as capital, production, competitiveness, and marketing issues. Competition levels in MSMEs are highly dependent on adopting digital technology. This research identified the potential of Indonesian MSMEs, analyzed MSME digitalization development, and identified challenges and opportunities in adopting digital transformation. This research is an initial literature review, followed by an applicative study of an MSME implementing digitalization technology. The study outlined that since the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 12 million MSMEs (18% of national MSMEs) have entered the digital ecosystem. After switching to digital platforms, 50.6% of MSMEs can increase their profit and turnover. However, Indonesian MSMEs face problems in the adoption of digitalization, such as low digital literacy, small and non-uniform production capacity, and suboptimal market access. To prepare for digitalization adoption challenges, human resources, adoption readiness, service readiness, infrastructure readiness, and business owners' motivation must be addressed. The opportunity for adopting MSME digitalization is to strengthen the innovation ecosystem through collaboration between the government, business actors, educational institutions, and stakeholders.  © 2025 Author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:22:28"",""2025-11-23 13:22:28"","""","""","""","""",""3277"","""","""",""MSME development through a digitalize ecosystem"","""","""","""","""",""American Institute of Physics"","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: AIP Conf.

This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of SCOPUS-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2024, complemented by case studies from Vietnam and South Africa. Key interventions include the application of blockchain technology to improve transparency, digital platforms to facilitate market access, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance production efficiency. The findings indicate that digitalization can increase smallholder farmers' incomes by up to 20% and reduce post-harvest losses by approximately 25%, although these figures vary by crop type and location. Persistent challenges include limited digital infrastructure, low digital literacy, and high adoption costs. Supporting strategies such as farmer training programs, inclusive financial access, product diversification, and national digital infrastructure policies are crucial to fostering sustainability.

The study examines the advantages and limitations of digital platforms in finance, healthcare, education, and entrepreneurship, particularly in improving resource access for marginalized communities and enabling economic functionality. By analyzing frameworks such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Diffusion of Innovations, the analysis presents how digital innovations address barriers like inadequate infrastructure and economic disparities. While mobile banking, telemedicine, e-learning, and digital financial services contribute to inclusive growth, challenges such as low digital literacy and regulatory issues persist. Older citizens, in particular, require targeted support due to limited digital skills. Using case studies and cross-sector themes, the review proposes strategies to maximize digital technology’s potential in reducing poverty and advancing sustainable development. Key findings reveal that mobile banking improves savings and credit access, e-learning narrows digital skills gaps, telemedicine increases rural healthcare access, and digital platforms stimulate SME growth. However, these benefits are uneven without strong infrastructure, digital literacy, and regulatory support.

Between 2018 and 2023, the project progressively implemented Nubeteca environments – equipped with technological devices and designed to facilitate access to digital reading – in public libraries throughout the Spanish province. According to research findings, these spaces not only contributed to a significant increase in digital lending but also fostered a renewed relationship between citizens and the library. However, infrastructure alone was not sufficient: the success of the model relied on parallel strategies of mediation, training, and above all, dynamization – understood as the continuous activation of digital reading practices. In this context, the role of the librarian became crucial as a facilitator of the transition and promoter of reading communities. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis showed a positive impact on changing reading habits, especially in rural areas or among populations with low digital literacy, as illustrated in the case study. Furthermore, the introduction of virtual reading clubs and hybrid activities strengthened the sense of belonging and enhanced the social and educational role of the library. From this perspective, the Nubeteca project stands out as a replicable model for redefining the central role of the library within the contemporary cultural ecosystem. © 2025 Associazione Italiana Biblioteche.

However, coastal SMEs face major challenges in fully utilising this potential, including an over-reliance on marine resources, low digital literacy, and limited access to capital and markets. These factors not only hinder innovation but also make coastal SMEs vulnerable to market fluctuations and environmental changes. This research seeks to identify these challenges, develop a digital-based empowerment model, and evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing SME competitiveness. A significant gap exists between the economic potential of coastal regions and SMEs' ability to fully harness available resources, especially in the context of digital transformation. The research explores which empowerment models can strengthen SME development and how these can be implemented effectively. Using a qualitative case study in Segarajaya, Bekasi, the research collected data through observations, interviews, training, and monitoring. The findings indicate that a digital-based empowerment model—incorporating digital literacy training, product innovation, and improved market access—can significantly enhance SME capabilities. The Coastal SME Digitalisation Centre has been effective as a hub for training, providing technological support and ongoing mentorship. Despite these achievements, inadequate digital infrastructure remains a barrier, and consistent government support is crucial to ensure long-term progress. The participants reported increased sales and improved business management post-training.

To address these challenges, we propose adapting metrics, adopted from cognitive psychology's Mental Model approach to assess non-specialist (non-technical) participants' understanding of two different types (SHAP, example-based) of XAI explanation. Utilizing a Healthcare scenario, we create a random forest model to classify a cancer diagnosis and create a series of explanation types. This paper presents a study to evaluate the effectiveness of these explanation types using metrics including understanding, trust, and perceived usefulness with non-specialist users. The results show that non-specialist users who had received one training session in SHAP trusted the SHAP explanation more than the example-based explanation, however 81% of participants thought that example-based explanations were more useful.  © 2025 IEEE."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:23:49"",""2025-11-23 13:23:49"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Remember Non-Specialists?"","""","""","""","""",""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Symp.

Data collection included surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions to assess information literacy and misinformation’s impact on trust. The findings reveal that while most farmers are aware of agricultural schemes, they predominantly rely on informal sources such as peers and family, with 36.5% citing them as their primary source, highlighting the role of social networks in information dissemination. The key challenges include low digital literacy, limited access to verified sources, and social influences affecting information trust. Statistical analysis indicates negligible correlations between education or experience and information literacy, though strong correlations exist among literacy skills.

Many barriers challenge implementing digital learning technologies in Africa, limiting access, disrupting learning activities and hindering full engagement and adoption of digital tools. Methods: A scoping review of original research publications from Africa was performed to explore stakeholder perspectives regarding the adoption and effectiveness of digital learning within midwifery education. The review aimed to examine and document stakeholder experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and challenges in existing literature, providing insights crucial to informing future strategies and policy decisions. Data from each study were collected using a custom-designed extraction form tailored specifically for this review. Results: After searching nine databases, 233 original manuscripts were located. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and nine studies remained for analysis. Content analysis was used to identify three main themes: (1) perceived benefits of digital learning, (2) facilitating factors, and (3) technical and technological challenges, which identified the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and challenges of stakeholders who have been exposed to using digital technology in midwifery education in Africa. Conclusion: There is a growing interest in integrating digital learning into midwifery education in Africa; however, this comes with contextual challenges such as limited infrastructure, access, and low digital literacy. Addressing these through targeted investment, comprehensive training, and other localized strategies is key to successfully implementing and scaling up digital education in preservice midwifery education on the continent.

Despite its importance, fragmented services, underfunding, and inequitable access undermine quality and safety, leading to preventable complications and hospital use. Objective: This narrative review evaluates the evolving medical, social, and technological needs of older adults receiving home-based care, highlighting persistent gaps and potential strategies to strengthen care delivery. Methods: Literature was searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2020 and June 2025, complemented by WHO policy reports. Peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and policy documents in English were included. Data were synthesized thematically across 3 domains: medical, social, and technological/environmental needs. Findings: Medical challenges included multimorbidity, polypharmacy, poor medication adherence, inadequate wound and pain management, and delayed recognition of acute deterioration. Social aspects were dominated by loneliness, caregiver burden, financial inequities, and insufficient cultural sensitivity in care models. Technological and environmental barriers encompassed limited access to assistive devices, housing inaccessibility, transportation gaps, and low digital literacy. Although telehealth and assistive innovations provide opportunities, their adoption is inconsistent and inequitable. Conclusions: Improving geriatric and home health care requires multidisciplinary collaboration, caregiver training, supportive policy frameworks, and equity-focused integration of digital and assistive technologies.

This study aims to propose an initial framework for a mobile welfare information system that improves accessibility and welfare equity by focusing on personalised and user-friendly design tailored to specific needs of people with disabilities. Methods: The study includes four stages. In Stage 1, key user needs for the system were identified. In Stage 2 South Korean and other countries’ welfare platforms were reviewed. In Stage 3, a back-end algorithm based on South Korea's national welfare platform, ‘Bokjiro’, was developed. In Stage 4, a core user interface (UI) was designed, focusing on perceived usefulness and ease of use. Results: In Stages 1 and 2, we identified user needs, including personalised welfare information without service omissions, integration of welfare resources, regional comparisons and user-friendly features and found that these needs were not adequately addressed by existing platforms. In Stage 4, we designed a UI based on the identified needs. User interface features include comprehensive personalised information recommendations, driven by the algorithm developed in Stage 3 and regional welfare comparisons to enhance the perceived usefulness. To improve ease of use, scenario-based guidance and the level of disability-inclusiveness of welfare information were also incorporated.

However, issues, such as technological literacy, infrastructural problems, and usability limitations, must be overcome before support systems can be created for healthcare integration. Method: A scoping review was carried out using the Arksey and O'Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2024 have been extracted from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Telemedicine interventions and outcomes for these populations were included in the studies included in the scoping review. Data are thematically synthesized focusing on barriers, facilitators, and effectiveness. Results: From 515 screened records, 45 studies made it to this review. Telemedicine promised to enhance healthcare access, have a better-managed chronic disease system, and save costs in all these populations. Sometimes, rural dwellers had to travel less, while older adults had improved adherence to their medications but not without some usability issues. Most children demonstrated significant improvements with chronic conditions and mental health support. From all these groups, typical barriers included limited digital infrastructure, low digital literacy, and cultural acceptance. Conclusions: Telemedicine promises to close the gap between vulnerable people and uplift them so that they have both quality and equitable healthcare services. Once there is addressing of systemic barriers including technological interfaces and users' engagement, it would optimize this potential. Further research would be needed on intervention tailoring to improve adoption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:24:31"",""2025-11-23 13:24:31"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""J.

The objectives of this review focus on the precision of dairy farming; exploring the role of Precision Dairy Farming in transforming Africa’s dairy sector, navigating challenges that hinder the adoption of Precision Dairy Farming in Africa, and seizing the opportunities that can be leveraged for sustainable growth in dairy farming. Precision Dairy Farming technologies include wearable sensors, automated milking systems, precision feeding systems (automated dispensers), automated environmental monitoring and cooling systems, milk analyzers and somatic cell counters, geospatial tools and GPS-Enabled Grazing Management, mobile apps for farm management and data analysis. According to different research results this technology adoption led to a 30% increase in milk yield, a 25% reduction in feed costs, and a 20% decrease in veterinary expenses. Also, it is important to improve animal health monitoring, enhance decision-making, reduce workloads, and enhance financial security. The precision of Dairy farming in Africa faces a range of economic, social, and environmental challenges that limit its growth potential, despite significant expansion opportunities. These challenges can be due to the high cost of technology, limited access to finance, infrastructural limitations, low digital literacy and limited training for farmers, data collection and management challenges, lack of adapted Precision Dairy Farming technologies for African conditions and policy and market Constraints making it hard for small farmers to adopt new tools and improve their productivity. Precision dairy farming have different opportunity such as, improving Animal health and welfare, empowering smallholder farmers with digital and mobile solutions, supporting economic growth and rural livelihoods, meeting the growing demand for dairy Products, driving sustainability and environmental protection, enhancing public-private partnerships and strengthening dairy market and supply chain resilience. By embracing Precision Dairy Farming technologies, investing in education, enhancing cooperative structures, improving market access, and supporting policy frameworks, stakeholders can collectively transform the dairy sector into a sustainable and resilient industry.

While the Digital Literacy of Teachers (DLT) framework has been introduced by the Ministry of Education, limited research exists on the psychological adaptation of EFL teachers to digitalization. Methods: This qualitative study explored the psychological transformation of 18 EFL teachers from six Chinese institutions who participated in a specialized 60-h digital literacy training program. Participants were purposively sampled for diversity, kept teaching reflection diaries, and engaged in in-depth interviews. Results: Post-training, teachers demonstrated a comprehensive digital mindset, including enhanced digital awareness, technology knowledge and skills, application, professional growth, and social responsibility. This shift not only improved their teaching abilities but also promoted positive psychological adaptation to digital change. Discussion: The findings underscore the importance of DLT-aligned training programs in supporting EFL teachers’ psychological transformation during digital transitions. Despite the qualitative approach and reliance on self-reported data limiting generalizability, this study illustrates the psychological impacts of digital training and provides practical guidance for implementing the DLT framework. Future research should employ quantitative methods and larger samples to further validate and extend these results.

The complex terrain of IoT and AI adoption in agriculture, exploring the obstacles to its advancement and the rewards that propel its expansion. Farmers face a number of difficulties as a result of the quick advancement of technology, including limited resources, low digital literacy, inadequate infrastructure, and worries about data security and privacy. These problems are made worse by resistance to changing traditional farming methods. Adoption of IoT and AI, however, has several advantages, including improved efficiency, favourable effects on the environment, and economic gains. Additionally, these technologies are essential for solving global agricultural problems and guaranteeing food security. Government assistance and policy efforts are important motivators because they can offer funding, training, and the establishment of a legal framework that promotes the adoption of new technologies. Innovation in the industry is further encouraged by research and knowledge exchange. In order to effectively overcome these adoption hurdles, a comprehensive strategy is required, encompassing publicprivate partnerships, extensive education and training, and international collaboration and information exchange. Adoption of technology must also take ethics into account. In order to demonstrate the revolutionary possibilities of IoT and AI in agriculture, case studies of effective adoption initiatives are investigated, providing insight into their favourable results and the lessons discovered. In the end, as agriculture develops further, (Vadivelu et al., 2023)the secret to realising the full potential of IoT and AI in farming and opening the door to a more technologically sophisticated, efficient, and sustainable future in agriculture is to strike a balance between these obstacles and favourable incentives. © 2025 Elite Publishing House.

There are mixed findings regarding the effectiveness of online counselling compared to traditional face-to-face counselling and other modalities. During the COVID-19 outbreak, online counselling services were advanced as the only safe means of attending to mental health conditions, especially during the lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of online counselling remains unclear, especially in developing countries with low digital literacy and poor Internet connectivity. This study's main purpose was to investigate and determine the clients' and therapists' perspectives on the effectiveness of online counselling during the pandemic based on the level of preparedness, mode of delivery, and challenges faced. The study used mixed methods employing a parallel convergent design and collected data from 284 participants (44 therapists and 240 counselling clients). The study found that therapists were not prepared to offer online counselling services, but were compelled by high demands for counselling services from clients during the pandemic. Both clients and therapists cited the cost of data bundles to connect to the Internet as a major barrier. Furthermore, both clients and therapists indicated that the most effective platform was video conferencing. The findings also show that therapists observed slowed progress in the client's recovery due to clients missing sessions. Logistic regression results on factors associated with preparedness and positive perception of online counselling showed that older therapists and lay counsellors were less likely to be prepared and evaluate sessions as less effective, respectively. Living in Lusaka (the capital) was associated with higher odds of perceiving online counselling as effective. Client results showed that older clients had lower odds of being prepared, and the counsellor being prepared increased the odds of the online counselling being perceived as effective. The researchers conclude that online counselling, in the context of a developing country, is ineffective because of the cost of Internet connection, the multiplicity of information communication technology (ICT) channels, low digital literacy, and lack of knowledge or experience using these platforms. © The Author(s) 2024."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:24:31"",""2025-11-23 13:24:31"","""","""","""",""1"",""12"","""",""BMC Psychol."","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd"","""",""C"	:\Users\guica\Zotero\storage\DNQJ6JZX\Mulungu et al. - 2024 - Effectiveness of online counsel	ling durin	g COVID-19 in Zambia.

However, the skills around research utilization are often assumed and rarely taught, particularly in low- and middle-income country contexts. Here we present a set of competency areas and learning objectives developed for institutionalization of research utilization across health professions schools in Liberia. Ahead of implementation and to gauge their perceived value and utility, a participatory formative evaluation was undertaken. Methods: Focus group discussions were held to gain feedback on a set of research utilization learning objectives and the proposed implementation approach. Focus group participants were drawn from faculty and students at the University of Liberia College of Health Sciences (ULCHS), which houses the country’s only medical and pharmacy schools, along with schools of public health and nursing and midwifery. ULCHS serves an essential role in the health workforce pipeline. Results: Findings from the focus group discussions identified a limited understanding of research utilization at the ULCHS but a demand for stronger understanding of research methodology and evidence. Participants identified clear examples of how the skills represented in the learning objectives could help specifically their personal careers as well as more broadly the health sector of Liberia. Potential challenges were noted around the incorporation of research utilization learning objectives into existing courses and tended to be logistical (for example, poor internet connectivity and low digital literacy) or around lack of foundational understanding and skills (for example, lack of experience with literature searches and reviews). However, the approach was generally perceived as contextually aware since it would not add new courses, which come with credit fees and extra time commitment, and would focus on practical skills-building rather than theoretical content. Conclusions: Integrating research utilization learning objectives into existing curricula in health professions schools is expected to enhance uptake and application of research evidence in the Liberian health sector, as students emerge from the workforce pipeline to"	fill positions in clinical and policy settings.

Results show that environmental concern and dissatisfaction with traditional vehicles (push factors), along with perceived convenience, subjective norms, and alternative attractiveness of NEVs (pull factors), positively influence switching intentions. Conversely, switching costs and habit (mooring factors) negatively impact the switching intention.

This study systematically examines the potential of gamification a design strategy that integrates game mechanics into non-game contexts as a behavioural intervention to foster sustainable energy practices in built environments. Drawing on psychological theories such as Self-Determination Theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour, and operant conditioning, the paper articulates how gamification can activate intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to encourage energy-saving actions. A critical synthesis of empirical studies from health, education, and energy domains illustrates the contextual adaptability and limitations of gamified systems. Through the development of a conceptual framework, this study elucidates the mechanisms through which gamification interacts with smart technologies, cultural settings, and institutional structures. Additionally, it addresses implementation bottlenecks, user segmentation strategies, and scalability challenges across residential, commercial, and educational building types. While the findings underscore the promise of gamification, they also caution against overreliance on extrinsic incentives and emphasize the need for adaptive system design. The paper concludes by proposing a research agenda that includes long-term empirical studies, culturally attuned deployment models, and hybrid policy-technological approaches to mainstream gamification in energy management. Rather than claiming a radical transformation, this work offers a grounded yet forward-looking vision for embedding behavioural intelligence into sustainable energy systems. © 2025 The Authors"",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"","""","""","""","""",""27"","""",""Result.

However, this critical topic is often overlooked or inadequately addressed in civil engineering education programs. To bridge this knowledge gap, a mobile application (app) was developed to facilitate learning about construction ergonomics for civil engineering students. This study investigates factors influencing civil engineering students' intention to use a mobile learning platform for construction ergonomics. Building upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which emphasizes perceived usefulness and ease of use, the researchers incorporated additional variables—perceived app quality, perceived enjoyment, and information quality—to provide a more comprehensive understanding of technology adoption in this context. Data were collected from 107 students at an affiliated institute of Anna University Chennai. The results showed that nine out of the ten proposed hypotheses were supported. Findings indicate that students perceive the app's information as useful, develop a positive attitude toward it, and are inclined to use it. This study contributes to ergonomics theory by providing a theoretical foundation for applying mobile apps in construction ergonomics education. The findings also have implications for practical innovation and the wider adoption of mobile learning in civil engineering education. © The Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"","""",""16805-16833"","""",""12"",""30"","""",""Educ.

In this paper, we adopted mixed methods research and explored the psychological factors that affect adoption intention to adopt intelligent messaging services among mobile users based on self-determination theory. After semi-structured interviews, we constructed a partial least squares structural equation model from the perspectives of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. In addition, openness and perceived complexity were also introduced as an extended dimension. Through an online survey, 548 valid questionnaires were obtained. The results show that intrinsic motivation has a greater effect on adoption intention. Specifically, attitude, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, and perceived system quality have significant positive impacts on the adoption intention of intelligent messaging, while perceived complexity has a negative direct impact on adoption intention. Although perceived competence and perceived media richness have no significant effects on adoption intention, an indirect effect on adoption intention through attitude was observed. Notably, perceived interactivity and openness have no effect on adoption intention.

This study introduced a VR technology acceptance model (TAM) to fulfil these requirements. The proposed model highlighted language learning anxiety (LLA) as a critical factor and delineated secondary school students’ acceptance of VR technology through four classroom climate constructs: respecting viewpoints (RV), promoting mutual respect (PMR), academic support from teachers (AS) and promoting interaction (PI). The current study surveyed 512 secondary school students using a questionnaire. Data gathered were scrutinised utilising structural equation modelling for the assessment of the hypothetical model. This research validated the suitability of TAM in elucidating the acceptance of VR technology for English learning. Perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influenced perceived usefulness (PU). PU and PEOU positively influenced secondary school students’ attitudes towards using VR. Amongst the four classroom climate dimensions, AS and PMR significantly negatively affected secondary school students’ LLA, whereas PI and RV had no significant effect on LLA.

The transition triggers a demand for a workforce skilled in both the technical and analytical aspects of these tools. While sensing technologies and data analytics can support construction processes, the inherent complexity of sensor data processing often exceeds the skill sets of the graduating workforce. Further, integrating sensor-based applications into construction curricula lacks evidence to support effectiveness in training future professionals. Computational thinking-supported data practices can allow construction students to perform sensor data analytics, spanning from data generation to visualization. This pilot study utilizes InerSens, a block programming interface, as a pedagogical tool to develop construction students’ computational thinking through sensor-based ergonomic risk assessment. Twenty-six undergraduate students were engaged in instructional units using wearable sensors, data, and InerSens. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated by examining students' perceived self-efficacy in sensor data analytics skills, task performance and reflections, and technology acceptance. Results show gains in self-efficacy, positive technology acceptance, and satisfactory performance on course assignments. The study contributes to the Learning-for-Use, constructivism, and constructionism frameworks by integrating computational thinking into graphical and interactive programming objects to develop procedural knowledge and by summatively assessing how construction students learn to address challenges with sensor data analytics. © 2025 The author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"",""2025-11-23 13:26:10"","""",""65-91"","""","""",""30"","""",""J.

Two digital solutions are available: virtual fitting to try on clothes or using a 2D anthropometric measurement system to select the correct size. However, consumers’ experiences and perceptions of 2D measurement systems vary. To understand consumers’ willingness to adopt 2D anthropometric systems, this study reviewed the current use of these systems in China and abroad and created a model to identify the factors that influence adoption. The model was based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), with consumer perception as the mediator. Hypotheses were proposed based on this framework. A questionnaire survey was conducted to test these factors. A total of 410 valid responses were analyzed using SPSS to confirm the reliability and validity of the measurement dimensions. Then, structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses, and the results showed good model fit. Finally, path analysis and mediation tests revealed that consumer perceptions mediate the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and adoption attitudes. These findings highlight the importance of these factors in predicting consumer adoption of new systems. Fashion managers and designers should adjust marketing strategies and technology development based on factors like perceived usefulness, ease of use, and consumer perceptions (e.g., enjoyment, value, and risk) to encourage adoption.

In order to propose solutions to the phenomenon of contractors being hesitant to participate in CE implementation in developing countries, this paper aims to comprehensively explore the enabling factors that motivate contractors to implement CE. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the push-pull-mooring (PPM) theory and extends it by introducing information provision (IP) as a trigger on contractors’ intrinsic subjective initiative states on CE implementation. The study considers what and how positive pull, negative push and neutral mooring factors influence the contractors’ CE transition. The framework was validated by questionnaires collected from contractors in China, and the data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. Findings: The findings indicate that all factors from the PPM framework exert a positive influence on CE intention, with push factors demonstrating a greater average impact. Furthermore, this study confirms the influence of the IP on contractors’ CE intentions by influencing their intrinsic status. The impact of the IP is most pronounced in terms of contractors’ perceived usefulness and environmental concerns. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the CE transition studies by extending the PPM theory into the construction industry through the lenses of contractors in developing countries. The results highlight the trigger impacts of the IP on contractors’ psychological status regarding CE transition. Furthermore, it offers insights into government management in the CE transition by providing the government with novel approaches to facilitate the CE transition in the construction sector. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Eng.

This may limit our understanding about how e-government service could be utilized to close the grey digital divide. This study explored the extent to which techno-stressors from e-government service affected seniors’ satisfaction and uncovered the underlying psychological mechanisms by tapping into the cognitive and emotional processes. Based on survey data of 302 Chinese senior adults who had the experience of using e-government service, the results revealed that both techno-complexity and techno-risk were techno-stressors negatively associated with the seniors’ satisfaction toward e-government service. Moreover, techno-self-efficacy and techno-anxiety were demonstrated to link techno-stressors to e-government satisfaction in a slightly different manner. While techno-risk was associated with e-government satisfaction via only techno-self-efficacy, techno-complexity was channeled to e-government satisfaction via both techno-anxiety and techno-self-efficacy. The findings underscore the importance of eliminating techno-stressors for better inclusion of seniors and offer a dynamic view for the intervention of techno-self-efficacy and techno-anxiety by considering them as malleable psychological processes rather than inherent features of senior people preceding their use of e-government service. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""207-233"","""",""3"",""43"","""",""J.

Compared to physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), or galvanic skin response (GSR), eye tracking offers a less intrusive method for the classification of cognitive load. However, previous studies that used traditional machine learning faced limitations in the accuracy of multiclass classification and relied on proprietary feature extraction methods. Hence, it hinders reproducibility with noncommercial software. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach by implementing three time series deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)—to enhance cognitive load classification in multiclass scenarios. By introducing various temporal windows for novel features and optimizing hyperparameters during training, we improved the accuracy of cognitive load classification. We benchmarked these deep learning models against traditional machine learning techniques on the COLET dataset. The experimental results revealed that deep learning models significantly outperformed conventional machine learning methods, with BiLSTM achieving the highest accuracies of 0.8780 and 0.8836 for the classification of cognitive load and activity tasks in multiclass scenarios, respectively. This study highlights the potential of deep learning to revolutionize cognitive workload assessments. Using eye movement indices, our method facilitates accurate, scalable, and cost-effective solutions suitable for low-cost eye tracking devices, broadening accessibility for applications in education, healthcare, and beyond. © 2013 IEEE."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""167324-167343"","""","""",""13"","""",""IEEE Access"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""","""","""","""",""cognitive load; deep learning; Eye tracking; human–computer interaction; user experience"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

This study examined whether readiness for wearables can predict employees’ acceptance of these devices in the workplace. It explored the factors of technology readiness influencing acceptance and attitudes towards wearable use. A quantitative research approach was adopted, involving 8,081 employees from the South African Department of Employment and Labour (DEL). Census sampling was employed, with questionnaires distributed electronically, resulting in 351 responses. The Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) was the measuring instrument. Four hypotheses were formulated to investigate the relationship between readiness and acceptance of wearables. Results indicated that eagerness, optimism, and discomfort in the technology readiness scales significantly predicted technology acceptance. Specifically, optimism and eagerness were consistent positive predictors, while discomfort negatively impacted two of the three acceptance dimensions. Insecurity was not found to be a predictor of acceptance. The study recommends revising DEL's digital transformation policy to embrace wearables, emphasizing their potential for seamless integration. Additionally, it identifies a positive attitude as a new dimension of the TRAM, contributing to establishing a Wearable Readiness and Acceptance Model (WRAM), which has not been previously introduced in the literature. © 2024 The Author(s).

The focus is on studying the dynamics of convergence and erosion, aiming to understand the impact of current digital transformations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, sustainability considerations and technology integration on AE. Design/methodology/approach: A scientometric analysis and bibliometric search were performed to understand the current knowledge in the field. The Web of Science (WoS) was selected for its comprehensive collection of significant research articles and integrated analytical tools for generating representative data. The study involved an extensive bibliometric analysis of 131 journal articles on TD in AE from 2000 to 2023. Subsequently, the VOSviewer software was employed to illuminate the transformative impacts of technological advancements on AE. Robust methodologies, including citation analysis and co-citation networks, unravel quantitative dimensions such as publication trends, influential authors, prolific journals, geographic distribution and prevalent themes or technological domains within the discourse. Findings: The findings reveal significant evolution in AE due to TD, with notable shifts influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, sustainability concerns and the integration of modern technologies. Key findings include the increasing adoption of online platforms and technologies like Building Information Modeling (BIM), the crucial role of design thinking methodologies and the recognition of innovative modules such as architectural photogrammetry and augmented reality (AR) applications. Furthermore, keyword clusters were classified into six groups: “AE pedagogy and curriculum development,” “Development of architectural design process and studio,” “Educational approaches and digitalization in architectural design,” “Transition to online AE,” “Development/emergence of photogrammetry at architectural education” and “use of AR.” Originality/value: Although several studies have addressed TD in AE from various perspectives and methods, they have yet to investigate the subject using scientometric analysis from a holistic perspective. A holistic exploration of TD in AE still needs to be improved in the existing literature. In contrast to previous investigations, this study is the first to leverage the quantitative analytical capabilities of VOSviewer.

In particular, we investigate how ethnic minorities (EMs), contingent workers (CWs), and interpersonal justice (IJ) influence KH in these projects. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), we reveal the significant effects of EMs and CWs on KH and the partial mediation of IJ between EMs and KH. We also find that control variables such as gender and age have significant impacts on KH. The findings underscore the pivotal role of inclusive practices in mitigating KH and enhancing KM in ICPs.

Specifically, this study conducts a systematic literature review of literature reviews focusing on student-centered learning to reveal research trends, gaps and future directions related to the factors and principles of SCL and the classifications of technologies in SCL environments. The obtained results found that cognitive and metacognitive were the most covered SCL factors, followed by factors related to motivational, affective and individual differences. Additionally, technologies for management were the most utilized in SCL environments and supported both cognitive and metacognitive, as well as motivational and affective factors and principles of SCL. The findings further revealed several challenges when adopting SCL, such as pedagogical, environmental, technological, curriculum, or social related. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""7813-7854"","""",""7"",""29"","""",""Educ.

The salience, effort, expectancy, value (SEEV) model, which combines top-down and bottom-up attention mechanisms for predicting attention allocation, has been validated in research areas such as piloting, driving, and surgical operations. However, the validity of the SEEV model in the field of robotic arm teleoperation has not yet been thoroughly studied. The primary purpose of this study was to confirm the feasibility of the SEEV model for operator visual attention allocation prediction in a robotic arm teleoperation scenario. The improved ITTI algorithm, distance-measuring tool, Delphi method, and lowest ordinal algorithm were adopted to qualify the four factors of the SEEV model, which also contributed to salience and expectancy quantification methods. Accordingly, an attention allocation prediction model in a robotic arm teleoperation scene was constructed. To verify the validity of the prediction model, 20 participants were recruited to control the robotic arm using V-REP simulation software, and their fixation durations were recorded using an eye tracker as an attention allocation indicator. Participants controlled the robotic arm according to the experimental requirements and operational tasks, such as grasping and placing the target. The results demonstrated that the theoretical data based on the SEEV prediction model are significantly related to the proportion of fixation durations. The experiment verifies the suitability of the SEEV prediction model, and it is anticipated to be utilized in the optimization of interactive interfaces for robotic arm teleoperation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""132-146"","""",""2"",""34"","""",""Hum Fact Ergon Manuf"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc"","""","""","""","""",""attention allocation; eye movement experiment; robotic arm teleoperation; SEEV model; V-REP"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Furthermore, the full benefits of BIM cannot be achieved without construction site operatives that are knowledgeable and proficient in BIM. Despite the creation of educational models for BIM training by colleges targeting construction professionals, there is currently no specific BIM learning model for construction site operatives. The aim of this research is to develop a BIM learning model to assist construction site operatives in their BIM transformation. The study employed a positivist philosophical research design, which required the use of a quantitative technique. The BIM learning model for construction site operatives was developed by using the SAMR (substitution, augmentation, modification, and redefinition) model, Bloom’s digital taxonomy, social learning theory, and design thinking theory. The hypotheses derived from the model were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study findings indicate that the learning standards for BIM tools, BIM technologies, and BIM skills will enable construction site operatives to effectively utilize BIM tools. The most crucial factor in learning standards for BIM tools is the implementation of substantial BIM tools to modify work processes. The findings also indicated that engaging in professional role-play and interactive assignments had the greatest influence on learning results. The research asserts that the model’s implementation will improve performance and efficiency on construction sites by providing construction site operatives with the necessary abilities to proficiently utilize BIM technologies.

It seeks to compare their perceptions and attitudes with those of professionals from other industries to assess the rate of AL adoption in the construction sector. Furthermore, the study aims to identify the factors influencing construction professionals’ intention to adopt AL technologies. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted with 188 construction professionals and 153 non-construction professionals. By employing the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and the general extended technology acceptance model for e-learning (GETAMEL), this study also explored factors influencing construction professionals’ behavioural intention (BI) towards AL adoption. An SEM-machine learning approach facilitated the evaluation of the factors’ influence on BI. Findings: A comparative analysis of the data found that construction professionals’ intention to use AL surpassed 75%, which had no significant difference with professionals from other industries. The findings revealed that learning value (LV) and self-efficacy (SE) were statistically significant predictors of construction professionals’ intentions to use AL. Furthermore, a supervised machine learning analysis identified performance expectancy (PE) as a crucial factor in predicting these intentions. Research limitations/implications: The study’s focus on self-reported intentions and a specific demographic limits its generalisability; further research should examine actual usage across diverse cultures. Practical implications: The results offered insights into construction professionals’ perceptions and attitudes towards AL adoption, guiding the integration of AL into construction professional development.

While several studies have used AR to enhance learning for individuals with disabilities, there is a significant gap in research focusing on generating captions within AR environments to optimize the experience for users who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH). This study aims to investigate a personalized captioning strategy tailored to the unique needs of the DHH community. To achieve this, a scoping review of published articles in three databases was conducted to discover how captions are generated, where they are placed, and what attributes of captions are personalizable in AR spaces. Using the PRISMA methodology followed by an interview, the study identified nomenclature discrepancies in AR spaces for hand-held devices, proposing the terms “world-lock-view” and “screen-lock-view”. While analyzing captioning technology, the study identified a lack of customization options in Automatic Speech Recognition implementations. This is particularly significant for DHH users in AR spaces, who require control over font styles, background settings, and caption placement to enhance accessibility for DHH users within AR environments, contributing to a more inclusive and enriched learning experience. The study also discusses the limitations of the captioning strategy and proposes solutions to these limitations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""3-21"","""","""",""15028 LNCS"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

An extensive review of the literature highlights a significant gap in empirical research regarding the adoption of MT and faculty adaptation when viewed through the lens of group dynamics. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on an exploratory study conducted at two engineering universities in France. A qualitative method enabled a comprehensive examination of faculty members using multiple field-based observations and semi-directive interviews at both University A and University B. Findings: While extant research tends to prioritize individual-level approaches, the integration of MT within higher education inherently involves social dynamics. Our results reveal that faculty’s perceived control and their initial perception over adoption of MT play an important role in shaping their adaptation behavior. The findings suggest that the adoption of MT among faculty members is influenced by various organizational factors. Specifically, the organizational logic of adoption affects their primary appraisal of MT, while group norms and social influence shape their adaptation acts. Furthermore, the organization’s continuous commitment to supporting faculty members also impacts their coping activities, ultimately influencing their overall adoption and utilization of MT. Originality/value: This study builds upon the limited yet growing body of literature on a theme highly relevant for practitioners, scholars as well as MT users in a higher education environment. The paper extends the CMUA by exploring the relationship between MT adoption and continuous user adaptation at both group and organizational levels. Our proposed framework assists universities in articulating their MT adoption and implementation strategy in harmony with a clear vision of their users’ adaptation activities before, during and after the implementation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Inf.

Due to their immersive and interactive nature, extended reality technologies and the metaverse could transform traditional collaborative learning in an attempt to achieve better learning outcomes. Immersive collaborative learning is an educational approach which combines immersive technologies (e.g. extended reality technologies and the metaverse) with collaborative learning and cooperative learning strategies and methods to render learning more effective, interactive, and engaging. Based on the results, the use of extended reality technologies and the metaverse can create the appropriate conditions and settings to enable immersive collaborative learning. Compared to traditional collaborative learning, immersive collaborative learning has the potential to further improve students’ development and learning outcomes, create more ubiquitous and inclusive learning environments. By integrating immersive collaborative learning, the social presence and social skills of students can be improved, and their learning achievements, engagement, and motivation can be increased. The use of extended reality technologies and the metaverse in immersive collaborative learning emerged as a means that provides meaningful learning and can support and enrich students’ cognitive and social-emotional development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."",""2024"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""101-111"","""","""",""Part F2842"","""","""",""Extended Reality and the Metaverse in Education"","""","""","""","""",""Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-57746-8_6"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

However, the lack of training transfer has long been a critical problem in the construction industry. As an attempt to gain a better understanding of the transfer of training, this research investigated factors affecting construction workers’ OHS training transfer intention. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from Australian construction workers, and 295 valid responses were obtained. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to test the model of transfer intention adapted from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Multigroup analysis was conducted to identify the similarities and differences in terms of factors affecting transfer intention among managerial/professional and non-managerial/manual construction workers. The research found that the TPB can be used to explain the transfer intention of OHS training among construction workers. Perceived behavioural control was found to be an antecedent of the intention to transfer among both groups of workers. However, attitudes only predicted transfer intention among managerial/professional workers, while subjective norms only predicted transfer intention among non-managerial/manual construction workers. The study provided a good understanding of the formation of transfer intention among managerial/professional and non-managerial/manual construction workers and identified critical factors influencing the transfer intention of these two groups. This new knowledge is useful for training providers and construction organisations to develop targeted strategies to increase the transfer of OHS skills and knowledge among construction workers and improve the effectiveness of OHS training. © 2023 The Author(s)"",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""","""",""167"","""",""Saf.

However, it is essential to systematically evaluate them to obtain consolidated evidence on the impact of IVR applications. Thus, the aim of this article is to present the state-of-the-art on all AECO/FM use cases, including learning theories/models, all key factors, and experimental design, and to suggest future directions for IVR research. This review follows a systematic literature review methodology to analyze 79 papers between 2013 and 2022. The results show that learning theories/models are not sufficiently applied. There is consensus that IVR influences affective factors positively. It is necessary to consider task type, task complexity, virtual environment design, and ergonomics of IVR tools in terms of cognitive factors. Cognitive/affective factors associated with learning performance should be examined in depth to develop more effective learning methods. Future studies should design and conduct experimental procedures with more scientific rigor. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""1465-1491"","""",""5"",""31"","""",""Comput Appl Eng Educ"",""Immersive virtual reality in AECO/FM to enhance education"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc"","""","""","""","""",""AECO/FM; education; immersive virtual reality; systematic literature review; training"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

The potential utility of immersive technologies (ImTs), including virtual and augmented reality, has recently received significant attention. However, the construction industry, especially in developing countries, lags on the implementation of technology generally and ImTs specifically. Forecasting the potential successful ImTs acceptance at the individual level is essential to strategic planning. The study's objective was to develop and test a conceptual model of factors influencing ImTs acceptance at the individual level in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of construction management-level professionals in South Africa was undertaken. The study extended two complementary models, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), to analyze behavior towards technology acceptance using structural equation modelling. Findings: Results indicated that attitude significantly influenced the intention to use ImTs and perceived usefulness (PU) positively and significantly predicted the intention to use and usage attitude (UA). Further, the effects of perceived enjoyment (PEn) on UA, and social norms (SNs) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) on intention to use were positive and significant. Perceived ease of use (PEU) had negative and non-significant effects on intention to use and UA. By explaining 82% of the variance, the study established that the proposed model successfully evaluates how management-level professionals in the construction industry accept ImTs. Practical implications: The study provides valuable insight into the acceptance of ImTs from the perspective of management-level stakeholders in the South African construction industry. It offers fundamental direction to create a general theory on integrating ImTs in construction. Originality/value: This study systematically surveyed the intention to accept ImTs in the South African construction industry using an extension of the TAM and TPB models. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""2645-2668"","""",""7"",""30"","""",""Eng.

Subsequently, more than 53 million migrant workers, comprising the main workforce of China’s construction sector, require transitioning into the roles of high-quality and highly skilled construction industry workers. As an important means to improve human capital, systematic training is the key method for the development of migrant workers into industrial workers within China’s construction industry. This paper constructs and verifies the theoretical model underlying the operating mechanism of the training system for migrant workers within the construction industry. As such, a structural equation model was established for the mechanism of transforming construction migrant workers into industrial workers. The results show that as the driving forces, the government and construction industry play important roles in promoting the operation of the training system for migrants in the construction industry as they provide internal vocational and social training. Construction enterprises have a direct role in promoting professional literacy training as one of the direct beneficiaries of construction workers’ training. Therefore, this paper provides a critical reference for policy promoting the transformation of migrant workers into industrial workers through appropriate training within China’s construction industry. © 2023 by the authors."",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""",""8"",""13"","""",""Buildings"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)"","""",""C:\Users\guica\Zotero\storage\U2QGCBNV\Ke e Bian - 2023 - Systematic Training to Improve the Transformation of Migrant Workers into Industrial Workers within.pdf"","""","""",""construction industry; industrial workers; migrant workers; structural equation model; training"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Seven risk attributes were chosen from the risk perception literature to evaluate 27 risks and hazard activities using a survey questionnaire developed based on the psychometric paradigm literature. The collected data were then analyzed using the AHP to determine the priority weight for each risk attribute. The results showed that the most crucial risk attribute was voluntariness of risk, followed by chronic catastrophic and newness of risk. Furthermore, the study found that natural hazards were ranked the highest, followed by refugee influx and fire hazards. In contrast, the mobile phone was perceived as posing the lowest type of risk.

One potential deterrent to adoption of such collaborative work methods often cited by industry stakeholders is resistance by workers stemming from their fear of losing their jobs or having to learn new approaches and methods of performing construction work. Although significant prior studies have used path analyses to statistically evaluate hypotheses about technology adoption models by estimating the relationships in the models, no research has specifically investigated the intention to work in HRC through such an approach. This study addresses this knowledge gap and empirically investigates the factors affecting construction personnel's behavioral intention to accept HRC. HRC in this study is envisioned as robotic assistants performing the physically demanding repetitive work while construction personnel focus on cognitive tasks necessary to plan and supervise the work. An HRC adoption model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT) is presented. This study expands a TAM-IDT model with new constructs such as job satisfaction and openness to training to explore an improved model that increases the understanding of construction personnel's intention to adopt HRC. Data collected from 156 construction personnel were analyzed to identify the key components based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The proposed model, consisting of eight external and four internal variables, was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicated that variables such as perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) had a positive and significant impact on behavioral intention (BI) to work in the described HRC system. Both theoretical and management implications emerging from the study are offered as insights to assist the construction industry in managing the introduction and adoption of HRC for on-site construction.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers."",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""",""3"",""39"","""",""J Manage Eng"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)"","""","""","""","""",""Construction personnel; Human-robot collaboration (HRC); Innovation diffusion theo"	"ry (IDT); Structural equation modeling (SEM); Technology acceptance model (TAM)"","""","""","""","""","	""""","""","""","""	""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","	""""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""	""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""	""","	""""","""","""	""""

A number of barriers have been identified that inhibit the effective reporting of safety incidents. Adopting an electronic incident reporting system (E-IRS) has immense potential to overcome these barriers and enhance incident reporting frequency in the construction industry. Nonetheless, the successful implementation of E-IRS requires an in-depth understanding of users' acceptance of the system and the factors influencing its usage. This research employed a cross-sectional design based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to quantitatively examine the factors influencing the adoption of E-IRS in the construction industry of developing countries. Data were collected using an online questionnaire survey to test the 11 hypothesized relationships. A total of 128 completed responses are retrieved and the results are analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use and trust are critical determinants that influence the acceptance behavior of E-IRS. Facilitating conditions and technological self-efficacy have a significant positive effect on perceived ease of use. In addition, social influence is found to have a significant impact on trust.

This study examines the instrumental adoption factors to adopt HRIS in boosting employee innovation outcomes from technological, organisational, people, and social outlooks. The empirical data consisting of 500 valid datasets were obtained from public servants in Indonesia via web-based questionnaires. structural equation modelling (SEM), which was used to examine the relationship among constructs. Technology fit, organisational resources, knowledge, and social influences have positive impacts on technology adoption. However, when treated as a mediation, the negative path from HRIS to innovation outcomes implied that e-HRM reflected in HRIS implementation would not make employees innovative. The scrutinized under ability, motivation, and opportunity (AMO) framework and empirical insights clearly portray that Indonesian’s ability to fit into this framework is problematical, making technological innovation in the Indonesian public sector only complimentary, not compulsory.

The designer's mental processes are crucial as they determine how designers address challenges and construct appropriate decisions. Hence, this study aims to investigate the cognitive criteria that can improve visualisation in the design review practice. This research conducted video interviews with a group of experts in the construction industry to elicit their feedback regarding the topic of virtual collaboration for quality assurance during the design review phase. The authors analysed the collected data using thematic analysis to develop cognitive criteria that improve decision-making during design review.

Several factors that cause these accidents range from inadequate experience, short job tenure, insufficient training, etc. Therefore, this study harmonizes safety and health practices at work towards technician’s productivity in the workplace. A total of 1,080 registered technicians in workplaces in Lagos State, South-West region, Nigeria, were used as sample in this study. The samples were selected using purposive sampling technique. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used during the empirical analysis to achieve the model fits. The study shows that there is a significant influence of the health and safety practice constructs (job safety, coworker’s safety, supervisor’s safety and management of safety practices) on the construct of theory of planned behaviour (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intentions) to further enhance technician safety and health practices/safety behaviour. The result from the study indicates that school-based occupational safety and health education may contribute to future reduction in job-related injury, to ensure that safe and healthy work becomes important to the student experience. © 2023 The Author(s).

The REDGeneral Questionnaire, or Questionnaire of Resources, Emotions/Experiences and Demands in users of ICT (2011), was applied. The results indicated moderately high levels of technostress among the students, with higher technostress being observed in the study sample when compared to the normative population. These levels were higher among the female gender, younger ages, students of initial courses, and those of degrees not related to the use of ICTs. Likewise, it was found that technostress had a negative influence on academic performance.

A systematic review and detailed content analysis of 50 post-screened articles related to SG in construction/building have depicted the current state and consolidated view on the applications of SG in construction. The applications of SG were categorized into several subject matters, such as construction safety, management and fire evacuation. Further, an overall classification system for SG in construction has been established, by including elements such as user and purpose. Based on the established classification, a SG process framework was developed and the framework could serve as a reference for construction stakeholders/game developers in designing games for their needs.

AR technology allows users to learn and practice in a simulated environment that enables repetition, correction, and failure without risk. The present study evaluated users’ attitudes towards using AR for learning complex tasks. The users are asked to interact with an AR Piling (ARP) application that shows various steps of a construction process. A set of selected practitioners and students used the application, and the evaluation involved various participants of different genders and backgrounds. A questionnaire was designed and data was collected through an online survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The model is modified considering education practices and adjusted to an AR app for learning purposes. The novelty of the model lies in various constructs such as technical quality, social influence, perceived immersion, learning, and perceived enjoyment. 200 responses were obtained and used for evaluating the proposed model. The attitude toward using AR and the perceived usefulness of AR were the two factors that determined the participants’ behavioral intention to use ARP. Respondents showed a high level of acceptance for AR. In education and higher learning contexts, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of how AR is accepted in complex learning environments.

However, the development trend of PC technology diffusion remains unclear, which is not conducive to improving the PC’s promotion. To address this issue, this study predicts the diffusion trend of PC technology considering multi-factor interaction and reveals its underlying mechanism. The significance of influencing factors of PC technology diffusion is explored through the empirical research method based on partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The diffusion trend of PC technology is then predicted using the system dynamics considering the interaction of those key factors. The results indicate that both perceived superiority and knowledge sharing have positive influences on PC technology diffusion, and they mediate the path from organizational climate to PC technology diffusion. Network embeddedness influences PC technology diffusion through knowledge sharing. Under the above-factors interaction, PC technology diffuses continuously until stability in the next 48 months, with a diffusion speed trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The diffusion prediction of PC technology under multi-factor coupling in this study fills up the gap in existing research. The conclusions are suggestive for promoting PC technology effectively. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."",""2023"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""333-353"","""",""3"",""51"","""",""Build Res Inf"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Routledge"","""","""","""","""",""diffusion prediction; multi-factor coupling; partial least squares-structural equation modelling; Prefabricated construction technology; system dynamics"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Based on the weak association model (WAM), we proposed two potential guidelines to deal with distraction and then improve these aspects. Guideline1 is directly decreasing the amount of attractive but task-irrelevant distractors in VELE. Guideline2 is enhancing the congruence between distractors and primary task by guiding attention from task-irrelevant distractors to task-relevant elements. To explore the effect of the guidelines, this paper develops a prototype VR experiential learning system, based on which two experiments were performed. Experiment 1 and experiment 2, respectively, conducted a comparative experiment to test the effect of guideline 1 and guideline 2 on flow, performance, and flow-performance link. Results show that both guidelines helped enhance the learning performance without any damage on flow experience and alleviated the weak flow-performance link.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a questionnaire study, and all the respondents are undergraduates in Barcelona, Spain. A total of 188 students are selected as survey subjects. Data collection applies the five-point Likert scale, and the collected information refers to demographic information and constructs related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and partial least square (PLS) are used to examine the measurement model's convergent and discriminant validity and test the hypotheses implementing the bootstrapping method. Findings: The results show perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are influential in forming an attitude (ATT), and PU could directly impact BI significantly. Additionally, the mediating role of ATT in the relationships amongst PU, PEOU and BI are investigated. Besides, perceived behavioural control (PBC) is found a critical variable and significantly impacts BI, whereas subjective norms (SN) is not found statistically significant in explaining BI in this study. Originality/value: This study has confirmed that ATT has a positive mediation effect on PU, PEOU and BI. This study has also confirmed the validity and model fit of the incorporated model of TAM and TPB, which sufficiently accounts for the planned behavioural process of undergraduates to accept a MOOC and contributes to validating literature of the incorporated model of TAM and TPB. Besides, this study provides MOOCs managers with practical suggestions. First, ease-of-use interfaces should be designed and intensified. Second, more channels should be explored to satisfy students' needs. Third, managers should intensify the leverage of the systems and introduce the free trial period to new learners. Fourth, a bonus mechanism could be adopted to motivate students. Last, manager should intensify the construction of oral advertisements amongst students. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""2022"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""1321-1342"","""",""7"",""36"","""",""Int.

The purpose of this study was to determine factors affecting behavioral intention to organize an online event during the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Overall, 366 sets of data were collected from respondents through a convenience sampling approach from several social media platforms. They were asked to fill the online questionnaire which had 40 questions under 8 segments. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that hedonic motivation was found to have the strongest effect on attitude, which subsequently led to behavior intention. In addition, online event promotion and perceived usefulness were also found to have significant effects on attitude, which also subsequently led to behavior intention. This study is one of the first studies that explored the behavioral intention to utilize an online event during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings would be beneficial mainly for online event organizers, particularly for enhancing the online event performance based on the contributing factors.

However, in conventional training programmes, sometimes it is difficult to situate learners in real cases owing to several considerations, such as cost and potential danger. Scholars have indicated that the lack of opportunities to experience real contexts could seriously affect the training outcomes. To cope with this problem, the present study proposes a spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR)-based professional training (SVVR-PT) approach based on the attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction (ARCS) model to situate learners in an authentic training environment to experience the process of solving practical cases before facing real cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, a true experiment was conducted in a hospital by randomly assigning 70 nurses to an experimental group learning with the SVVR-PT approach and a control group learning with the conventional training approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed the conventional approach in terms of promoting the learners' sense of presence and learning achievement as well as their problem-solving tendency and critical-thinking awareness. Moreover, the SVVR-PT learners also showed higher technology acceptance than the conventional training group. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) immerses learners in an authentic environment that enables them to have more opportunities to experiment and practice. Attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction model has great potential in promoting learners' motivation and engagement. What this paper adds? A motivational model-based virtual reality approach is proposed to facilitate learners' professional training performance. In addition to promoting learners' training performance, the results claimed that the proposed approach could promote students' sense of presence, problem-solving tendency and critical-thinking awareness. Implications for practice and/or policy It is potentially worth using the motivational model-based virtual reality approach in professional training to facilitate learners' performances and perceptions. The proposed approach can further analyze and compare the effects of the cooperative le"	arning strategy on learners' performance and recorded learning process. © 2022 British Educat	ional Rese	"arch Association."",""2022"",""2025-11-23 13:29:"	"09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"""	","""",""1343-1360"","""",""5"",""53"","""",""Br J"	E	duc Tec	hnol	""","""""	","""	""","	""""","""","	""""","	""""","""""	",""Engl"	is	"h"","	""""","""","""","""	""","	"""Scopus"	""","""","""	Publ	ish	er	: J	ohn W	ile	y	and	Son	s In	"c"","	""""","""	""","	""""","""","	"""p"	rofe	ssi	ona	l tr	ai	nin	"g;"	sense o	f	presen	"ce;"	sph	eri	cal video-b	ased	virtual	"reality; vi"	rtual real	"ity"""	","""""	","""","""","""	""","""	""","""""	","""","""","""","""""	","""	""","	""""","""""	","""	""","""	""","""""	","""","""","""","""","	""""","	""""","""	""","""","	""""","	""""","""	""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Many DGBL studies have been conducted in formal education settings but rarely was the effectiveness of DGBL on adult learners in the context of professional upskilling examined. To examine the influence of DGBL on professional upskilling, we conducted a systematic literature review examining DGBL research conducted over the past 10 years with adult learners. Through analysing 30 articles that met the inclusion criteria, three themes were developed: (a) characteristics of learning-driven digital games, which focus on various learning pedagogies and teaching strategies used in DGBL; (b) game design elements that were used to motivate and sustain players’ engagement in learning, and (c) the research findings that could influence the implementation of DBGL. Based on the results, we recommended a purposeful selection of game design elements as extraneous game design elements can inhibit the learning process. Pedagogical frameworks and teaching strategies, such as sustainable feedback and a supportive learning process, are also recommended for the implementation of DGBL. Lastly, the role of teachers and their knowledge about educational design and pedagogies can help ensure the effectiveness of the DGBL. In conclusion, our systematic literature review found supportive evidence for DGBL to be an effective teaching tool if the three areas, game design and development, use of pedagogy, and role of teachers, were addressed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""2022"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""","""","""","""",""184"","""",""Comput Educ"",""Designing digital game-based learning for professional upskilling"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Elsevier Ltd"","""","""","""","""",""Adult learners; Digital game-based learning; Digital games; Professional development"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

The application of VR in education is intriguing and warrants further examination, but research on the subject is currently restricted. VR can benefit education by allowing students to participate in memorable and engaging experiences that they would not otherwise be able to have. Traditional approaches are still used to teach students, which is an essential element of the curriculum for those who want to conceive problem-solving. As a result, there is a scarcity of study on VR deployment. In this paper, we investigated the factors affecting the adoption of VR in higher educational institutes. To this end, we extended the technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with four additional factors and formulated a set of hypotheses. The hypotheses are then evaluated using a dataset collected from 503 Jordanian students. The result shows that the factors perceived facilitating condition, perceived effort expectancy, and perceived compatibility significantly affected the intention to use VR systems and tools for educational purposes. We believe that this study will help decision makers to build sustainable learning and educational systems in Jordan universities. © 2022, Growing Science.

For this purpose, data were collected using survey questionnaires from 360 mineworkers recruited from mineral and sand mines. Respondents were asked to evaluate eight occupational and environmental risks and hazards on nine commonly used risk characteristics. The principal component analysis revealed that two components, “Dreaded” and “Unknown”, explained 73% percent of the total variance in workers’ risk perception. The results also showed that the risk of developing an occupational disease was perceived as the most dreaded and unknown type of risk, while landslide, occupational noise, and vibration exposure were the least familiar to the respondents. A practical implication of this research is that the results may offer an insight into the employees’ perceptions of the hazards and risks associated with their working environment.

It uses English as the medium and language of instruction to promote general education. As the most important content of undergraduate foreign language education, college English has different characteristics from other courses. It is only when its objectives, content, teaching activities, and assessment system fully reflect its unique requirements that it can truly achieve the ultimate goal of teaching this subject. With the advent of the information age, global economic integration and international exchange are deepening in various industries and fields. It is increasingly common for countries to require professionals to have foreign language skills, especially English as an international language. As a result, the demand for deeper English proficiency has become more prominent. In international communication, the English intercultural communication ability of key personnel directly affects the process of international communication, science and technology exchange, and the smooth transition of cultural conflicts in various fields and even determines the ultimate success of project cooperation. In this context, the effective use of English and cross-cultural communication skills is very important. Therefore, our higher education institutions are mainly responsible for training foreign language talents. However, the core problem facing English teaching in Chinese universities is the teaching value orientation. In particular, it seriously restricts the effectiveness of university English teaching. First, the value orientation of university English teaching deviates from the teaching objectives. It emphasizes the basic knowledge and skills of the English language, which makes teaching mainly stay on the foundation of the language. In other words, it is still limited to learning English for the sake of learning English, and the examination-oriented education is obvious, with a preference for instrumental teaching. Secondly, university English teaching focuses too much on the accumulation of English grammar rules and imitation drills, and the teaching style is dull and the teaching context is empty. This approach deviates from the characteristics of English intercultural communication, which makes the gap between the actual university English teaching and the real intercultural communication more and more obvious. Third, university English teaching lacks integration with other teaching values, especially with t"	he humanistic orientation of university English teaching. Nowadays, a single teaching value o	rientation	dominates university English teaching.

Unlike most of the other industries operating indoors within controlled environment, the construction workers share a fair amount of time outdoors exposing them to different climatic and workability. These transfigurations contribute towards more vulnerability for workplace accidents. It has been observed that there is a common absence of formal construction safety training programs for fresh workers that result in work accidents. Instead, employees are expected to learn from their own experiences and mistakes. One of the main causes is the inability to understand safety training material by the masses due to its presence in uniform languages and lack of education. Considering the need to overcome these inconveniences, this study focuses on the development of a Construction Safety for All (ConSafe4All) framework to produce safety training modules for workers to overcome the language restrictions.

The present research explored the relationship among the employees’ beliefs regarding self-confidence, grit, ease of use, self-efficacy, and usefulness of eLearning platforms in their workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 307 responses from Romanian employees who used eLearning platforms in corporate training (females = 60.3%, males = 39.7%, age range of less than 24 years (12.1%) to over 55 years (6.2%)) were exploited for research. Data were analyzed through a path analysis model. Results indicate that grit (i.e., consistency of interest), self-efficacy, and perceived ease of use of eLearning platforms were considerably directly influenced by the self-confidence variable. Usefulness was directly influenced by the ease of use and was indirectly influenced by self-confidence. Mediation analysis indicated that full mediation occurs only through the ease of use of eLearning platforms variable in the relationship between self-confidence and usefulness. A unit increase in self-confidence will increase the expected value of grit by 0.54 units (t = 8.39, p < 0.001), will indirectly increase the expected value of usefulness through ease of use by 0.15 units (t = 2.39, p = 0.017), and will increase the expected value of self-efficacy by 0.53 units (t = 6.26, p < 0.001). In addition, perceived ease of use of eLearning platforms in corporate training fully mediated the relationship of usefulness regressed on self-confidence (? = 0.20, t = 2.51, p = 0.012). These novel results reveal the contributions of self-confidence, consistency of interest as a grit dimension, and ease of use of eLearning platforms in predicting lifelong learning solutions, which improve business outcomes.

The critical review identified the conceptual, procedural, technical, and contextual forms of knowledge in practical tasks and activities. Based on these findings and drawing on the concept of semantic gravity in Legitimation Code Theory, we found stronger and weaker forms of semantic gravity in practical knowledge and propose that strengthening and weakening semantic gravity through the purposeful selection and sequencing of tasks and activities enables cumulative knowledge building towards competent practice. © 2021 The authors."",""2021"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""7-28"","""",""85"","""","""",""J.

During the development of the search string for the literature review, it was found that there were no available peer-reviewed articles on Engineering Asset Management competencies through an Australian local authority lens between January 2010 and December 2019 within the searched databases. Based on this, the search string criteria was re-focused onto Engineer Asset Management competencies within Australia (in general), as the new frame. Using this updated string search, the authors searched several databases (EBSCOHost, Informit, Scopus Informit and Web of Science) for research published in English between January 2010 and December 2019 that detailed the competencies deemed necessary for personnel undertaking Engineering Asset Management activities within the Australian context. Additional records were searched for in relation to the topic, from a range of Engineering and Engineering Management Conferences held between 2010 and 2019. Two hundred and thirty publications were identified through database searches, while eight conference proceedings were identified from the additional conference search. These were initially checked for duplicates, and then subjected to the refinement stage against a detailed review criteria, as per the PRISMA framework checklist process. Four articles progressed through the full PRISMA framework process. Further in-depth reviews of the remaining four papers found that one article was principally focused on the Australian Quality Framework (AQF) certification training processes, while the remaining three papers contained data of competency requirements (and example subjects) for Engineering Asset Management personnel within Australia. This data was collated, and through a deductive qualitative content analysis, was coded into three common themes: (1) Technical skills, (2) Professional skills–internally focused and (3) Professional skills–externally focused. The review process undertaken within this research initially showed that there were no papers within the original search frame of Australian local authorities, while the updated search detailed limited available literature within the general Australian context.

This article aims to present a novel goal programming based strategy which will be helpful to solve Multi-Level Multi-Objective Linear Programming Problem (MLMOLPP) with parameters as neutrosophic numbers (NNs). Difficulty in decision making arises due to the presence of multiple decision makers (DMs) and impreciseness in information. Here each level DM has multiple linear objective functions with parameters considered as NNs which are represented in the form c+ dI, where c and d are considered real numbers and the symbol I denotes indeterminacy. The constraints are also linear with the parameters as NNs. Firstly the NNs are changed into intervals and the problem turns into a multi-level multi-objective linear programming problem considering interval parameters. Then interval programming technique is employed to obtain the target interval of each objective function. In order to avoid decision deadlock which may arise in hierarchical (multi-level) problem, a possible relaxation is imposed by each level DM on the decision variables under his/her control. Finally a goal programming strategy is presented to solve the MLMOLPP with interval parameters. The method presented in this paper facilitates to solve MLMOLPP with multiple conflicting objectives in an uncertain environment represented through NNs of the form c+ dI, where indeterminacy I plays a pivotal role. Lastly, a mathematical example is solved to show the novelty and applicability of the developed strategy. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."",""2020"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""3175-3186"","""",""8"",""11"","""",""J.

However, advanced applications of these technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) businesses remain nascent. While it is in demand, the use of these technologies in developing the AEC digital pedagogy and for improving professional competence have received little attention. This paper presents a set of five novel digital technologies utilising virtual and augmented reality and digital twin, which adds value to the literature by showing their usefulness in the delivery of construction courses. The project involved designing, developing, and implementing a construction augmented reality (AR), including Piling AR (PAR) and a virtual tunnel boring machine (VTBM) module. The PAR is a smartphone module that presents different elements of a building structure, the footing system, and required equipment for footing construction. VTBM is developed as a multiplayer and avatar-included module for experiencing mechanisms of a tunnel boring machine. The novelty of this project is that it developed innovative immersive construction modules, practices of implementing digital pedagogy, and presenting the capacity of virtual technologies for education. This paper is also highly valuable to educators since it shows how a set of simple to complex technologies can be used for teaching various courses from a distance, either in emergencies such as corona virus disease (COVID-19) or as a part of regular teaching.

To develop a user-centred speech learning system using machine learning and speech recognition technology to improve speech fluency, we designed a user-centred speech training system and analysed the speech patterns of users using existing speech learning programs. We developed machine learning-based adaptive learning algorithms for recommending speaking areas. We designed user and instructor applications for speech learning and experiments that can be applied in real-life education. Based on the designed and developed method, we developed and evaluated the education model using the speech training system through a non-real-time foreign language speech training system similar to a real-time learning setting.

A conceptual framework was firstly proposed to explain the mechanism of how VR display features affect virtual experiential learning. Then, a single-factor within-subject experimental design was adopted for testing. The within-subject factor was three types of 3D display technology: fully immersive virtual reality (VR) mode [VR head-mounted display (HMD)], partially immersive VR mode (3D projection), and augmented reality (AR) mode (AR HMD). The dependent variables were visual comfort, interaction experience, learning experience, and outcome. A virtual math learning environment was established, and the aforementioned display technologies were tested in two hands-on virtual experiential learning scenarios. Results showed that different display technologies significantly affected users' visual comfort, interaction experience, learning experience, and outcome in experiential learning (ps < 0.05). User ratings on these aspects for the VR HMD were significantly higher than those for the 3D projection and AR HMD. Thus, the VR HMD contributes to a best viewing experience and learning experience in terms of hands-on virtual experiential learning in the scenarios tested. Whether the study results still hold reliably in terms of more complex learning activities and long-term learning needs to be further studied. © 2013 IEEE."",""2020"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""73791-73803"","""","""",""8"","""",""IEEE Access"",""Identifying the Optimal 3D Display Technology for Hands-On Virtual Experiential Learning"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""",""C:\Users\guica\Zotero\storage\STIHITD9\Zhou et al. - 2020 - Identifying the Optimal 3D Display Technology for Hands-On Virtual Experiential Learning A Comparis.pdf"","""","""",""augmented reality; Experiential learning; hands-on learning; virtual reality; visual comfort"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

The focus of this study was on automated vehicles (AVs) of level 3 (conditional driving automation) as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. A research model was proposed here by using the technology acceptance model (TAM) with trust, risk perception (perceived safety risk and perceived privacy risk), compatibility, and system quality. A cross-sectional structured questionnaire survey was used to collect quantitative data from 237 drivers in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed to test the proposed research model by structural equation modeling. The proposed research model was found to explain 68% of the variance in intention to use AVs. In contrast with the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, the results of this study indicated that trust was the most important factor in shaping a positive attitude towards using AVs, which affected driver intention to use AVs. Also, trust was found to be influenced by perceived safety risk, compatibility, and system quality. This study is the first attempt to consider technological factors related to AVs (compatibility and system quality) in explaining AV acceptance among drivers and highlighted the importance of the technological factors in the context of driver acceptance of AVs. Based on the findings of this study, several recommendations are discussed to help AV developers and governments to improve driver attitudes towards adoption of AVs.  © 2013 IEEE."",""2020"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""109845-109856"","""","""",""8"","""",""IEEE Access"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""",""C:\Users\guica\Zotero\storage\8YB6GWTD\Man et al. - 2020 - Critical Factors Influencing Acceptance of Automated Vehicles by Hong Kong Drivers.pdf"","""","""",""Acceptance; automated driving; compatibility; risk perception; system quality; trust"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

The vibration was an extra, fixed sensitive interface that informed the user that the avatar was walking through the virtual world. The combination of different interfaces within the applications allowed to (1) provide multisensory information to the user while exploring an unknown virtual scenario, (2) build a model of the space in which the user is located and (3) successfully perform tasks in the real world. This research compared different patterns for each interface: 3 for voice, 3 for the beep and 4 for gestures, during the exploration of an unknown space, with the goal of determining which ones were the most efficient and effective at detecting, identifying and locating structures and objects in an unfamiliar environment, aiding blind users to develop a cognitive map of the explored place and successfully perform tasks within the real scenario. Evidence shows that the voice interface provides a statistically significant difference on effectiveness, efficiency, and cognitive mapping compared to other interfaces. Most decisively, pairwise comparisons have shown that, when compared to a normal speech rate, a speech rate 2 times faster manifested an improvement of 5.9% on object and structures detection, a reduction on exploration time of 39.72%, an improvement of 6% on quality of cognitive map development and greater success in carrying out the absolute tasks. The beep interface with 500 Hz frequency and 100 milliseconds spacing provided a statistically significant difference for cognitive mapping, showing an improvement of 8.9%.

Based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML), we evaluated the predesigned AR-based learning tool using eye-tracking data. In this study, we tracked, compared, and summarized learners' visual behaviors in text-graph- (TG-) based, AR-based, and physical model- (PM-) based learning environments. Compared to the TG-based material, we find that both AR-based and PM-based materials foster extraneous processing and thus further promote generative processing, resulting in better learning performance. The results show that there are no significant differences between AR-based and PM-based learning environments, elucidating the advantages of AR.

This paper aims to address the problem by proposing a novel approach that integrates safety with construction materials and methods education. A system is proposed comprising of three sequential modules: (1) safety and hazard lecture (SHL) module; (2) hazard identification game (HIG) module; and (3) student evaluation and assessment (SEA) module.

Safety training have shown to establish positive attitudes towards safety among employees. The aim of current study is to analyze the effect of QR codes that link to Picture Mix EXposure (PIMEX) videos by analyzing attitudes to this safety training method and safety in student responses. Safety training videos were used in upper secondary school handicraft programs to demonstrate wood dust risks and methods to decrease exposure to wood dust. A preliminary study was conducted to investigate improvement of safety training in two schools in preparation for the main study that investigated a safety training method in three schools. In the preliminary study the PIMEX method was first used in which students were filmed while wood dust exposure was measured and subsequently displayed on a computer screen in real time. Before and after the filming, teachers, students, and researchers together analyzed wood dust risks and effective measures to reduce exposure to them. For the main study, QR codes linked to PIMEX videos were attached at wood processing machines. Subsequent interviews showed that this safety training method enables students in an early stage of their life to learn about risks and safety measures to control wood dust exposure. The new combination of methods can create awareness, change attitudes and motivation among students to work more frequently to reduce wood dust. © 2015 The Author."",""2016"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"",""2025-11-23 13:29:09"","""",""120-128"","""","""",""82"","""",""Saf.

A vast array of research exists that focuses on barriers of mHealth adoption in such domains. However, the majority of these papers embrace the concept of adoption to cover the entire process of implementation. This chapter acknowledges that various phases of implementation exist. As a result, the researchers identify potential barriers for each phase of mHealth implementation in developing countries. By examining extant literature, this study reveals that various sociocultural and technological factors across individuals and organizations collectively can hinder mHealth implementation in developing regions. Extant research indicates that the focus of mHealth in these constituencies, a nascent area of research, places too much emphasis on the benefits associated with mHealth implementation. Subsequently, this chapter endeavors to outline the barriers that should assist with overcoming common obstacles in the successful implementation of mHealth initiatives in developing countries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study defines green entrepreneurship as entrepreneurial activities that combine economic value creation with environmentally responsible practices that promote sustainability in business. This research enhances the domains of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and entrepreneurship education by illustrating how user-centered digital platforms may cultivate youth business competencies while promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GEJUR incorporates interactive learning modules, e-mentoring, and specific cultural features like weaved motifs (pola tenun), providing contextual relevance alongside essential LMS functions. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating surveys, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), semi-structured interviews, and usability testing. Quantitative data were gathered via the System Usability Scale (SUS), whilst qualitative data documented user impressions of obstacles and anticipations. The usability evaluation, conducted with 33 individuals, resulted in a mean SUS score of 48.9, which corresponds to approximately 71.9% of the benchmark score of 68. This positions GEJUR beneath the established threshold, classified as having “poor” usability, although it remains functionally workable. Participants effectively accomplished critical tasks including authentication, course access, and quizzes, and offered favorable feedback regarding the system’s cultural integration. The results highlighted critical areas for enhancement, such as interface uniformity, minimization of response times, and more explicit user feedback. The study finds that GEJUR offers a viable yet improvable foundation for digital entrepreneurship training platforms in underprivileged areas. Subsequent study ought to broaden testing to encompass bigger and more heterogeneous user populations and implement sophisticated UX evaluation criteria beyond the SUS.

Therefore, it is essential to explore additional ways to separate and cover space without preventing its accessibility, while also providing possibilities for personalization by the individual. To achieve this, we present StringWall, a tangible, projection-based user interface created from low-cost materials that can be integrated into any space or size. It consists of rubber strings tracked by a depth camera that can be adapted to the user's needs in terms of size and orientation. To evaluate our system, we conducted visibility tests for the projection and background under different conditions. Furthermore, we conducted two preliminary studies to explore the users' preferences in terms of different interaction methods and use cases, as well as the haptic feedback capabilities of our system. The results show that users found the system and proposed use cases engaging, and that the system is suitable for providing extended haptic feedback when physical restraints align with the user's expectations.

We developed three platform-specific agents with seven-layer character architectures and deployed them on Twitter/X, Discord, and Telegram for 18 days. The system processed 5389 interactions while gathering feedback from 28 volunteer participants. Addressing three research questions, we found that: (1) automation effectiveness was platform-dependent, with direct support platforms (Telegram, Discord) rated more useful than broadcast-oriented Twitter/X; (2) character design impact depended primarily on platform-persona alignment rather than architectural sophistication; and (3) technical performance showed platform-specific patterns, with median storage times ranging from 9.0 milliseconds (Twitter/X) to 61.5 milliseconds (Telegram) and high variability across all platforms. A notable finding was what we term the “Discord Paradox”—high quality ratings (4.05/5) but lowest preference (8.7%), suggesting platform familiarity and accessibility influence adoption more than agent quality. While the deployment demonstrated technical feasibility and revealed distinct user dynamics across platforms, the findings indicate that platform-specific optimization may be more effective than universal approaches.

This interdisciplinary study aims to develop a foundational understanding of how spiritual care may (or may not) be expanded into online spaces - especially focusing on anonymous, asynchronous, and text-based online communities. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study with chaplains (N=22) involving interviews and user testing sessions centered around Reddit support communities to understand participants' perspectives on technology and their ideations about the role of chaplaincy in prospective Online Spiritual Care Communities (OSCCs). Our Grounded Theory Method analysis highlighted benefits of OSCCs including: meeting patients where they are at; accessibility and scalability; and facilitating patient-initiated care. Chaplains highlighted how their presence in OSCCs could help with shaping peer interactions, moderation, synchronous chats for group care, and redirecting to external resources, while also raising important feasibility concerns, risks, and needs for future design and research. We used an existing taxonomy of chaplaincy techniques to show that some spiritual care strategies may be amenable to online spaces, yet we also exposed the limitations of technology to fully mediate spiritual care and the need to develop new online chaplaincy interventions. Based on these findings, we contribute the model of a ''Care Loop'' between institutionally-based formal care and platform-based community care to expand access and drive greater awareness and utilization of spiritual care. We also contribute design implications to guide future work in online spiritual care.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""7"",""9"","""",""Proc.

However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to generate the translations with chosen degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features influenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Drawing on these findings, we discuss several implications for facilitating science communication and designing steerable interfaces to support human-AI alignment.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""7"",""9"","""",""Proc.

Users of eHealth apps are naturally very diverse in terms of their human aspects, e.g., their emotional reactions to the apps, varying language proficiency, socioeconomic status, educational level, cognitive style, physical and mental challenges, gender, age, and personality. Unfortunately, many eHealth apps do not take these user differences sufficiently into account, making them ineffective or even unusable.

Despite their potential, many XR applications lack consistent design grounded in human–computer interaction (HCI), leading to challenges in usability, engagement, and learning outcomes. Through a comprehensive analysis of 50 peer-reviewed studies, this paper reveals both strengths and limitations in current implementations and suggest improvements for reducing cognitive load and enhancing engagement. To support this analysis, we draw briefly on a dual-phase learning model (L1–L2), which distinguishes between interface learning (L1) and conceptual or procedural learning (L2). By aligning theoretical insights with practical HCI strategies, the discussions from this study are intended to offer potentially actionable insights for educators and developers on XR design for STEM education. Based on a detailed analysis of the articles, this paper finally makes recommendations to educators and developers on important considerations and limitations concerning the optimal use of XR technologies in STEM education.

Measuring changes in fine motor abilities due to prolonged use or fatigue currently requires repeated manual testing. This paper analyzes the concept of using the digital mobile devices’ input behavior to assess the user’s Fine Motor Control. For this, we show that Fine Motor Control can be assessed for touch and stylus-based interaction with a digital mobile system. We conducted a user study, where participants performed a Nine Hole Peg Test and a predefined Copy Drawing Test before and after exercises that affect fine motor skills.

Speech interfaces have been explored as an alternative to hand input in research and commercial solutions, but are limited to initiating basic hand gestures and system controls. We introduce HandProxy, a system that expands the affordances of speech interfaces to support expressive hand interactions. Instead of relying on predefined speech commands directly mapped to possible interactions, HandProxy enables users to control the movement of a virtual hand as an interaction proxy, allowing them to describe the intended interactions naturally while the system translates speech into a sequence of hand controls for real-time execution. A user study with 20 participants demonstrated that HandProxy effectively enabled diverse hand interactions in virtual environments, achieving a 100% task completion rate with an average of 1.09 attempts per speech command and 91.8% command execution accuracy, while supporting flexible, natural speech input with varying levels of control and granularity. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""3"",""9"","""",""Proc.

However, the design of effective wearable behavior intervention systems remains relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted controlled studies focusing on the reduction of unwanted words (e.g., filler words, swear words) in daily communication through auditory feedback using wearable technology. We started with a design space exploration, considering various factors such as the type, duration, and timing of the auditory feedback. Then, we conducted pilot studies to reduce the space of design choices and prototyped a system called WSCoach (Wearable Speech Coach), which informs users when they utter unwanted words in near-real-time. To evaluate WSCoach, we compared it with a state-of-the-art mobile application supporting post-hoc conversation analysis. Both approaches were effective in reducing the occurrence of unwanted words, but WSCoach appears to be more effective in the long run. Finally, we discuss guidelines for the design of wearable audio-based behavior monitoring and intervention systems and highlight the potential of wearable technology for facilitating behavior correction and improvement.

However, how users adjust their typing behavior and visual attention to integrate the use of word suggestions and whether they are effective in doing so remains unclear, mainly due to the lack of gaze data in realistic settings. In this paper, we conduct an eye-tracking study of word suggestion users transcribing and composing text on their own phones and keyboards. Our analysis reveals that users frequently checked the suggestion list without picking a suggestion, yielding a 68% failure rate. Screen recordings show that only about half of these Failed Suggestions can be attributed to the algorithm’s performance. In 43.6% of cases, users typed the word manually even though they fixated on the correctly suggested word. We analyze the dynamics of users’ checking behavior and quantify the time cost of checking for word suggestions. Overall, we find that despite using word suggestions on a daily basis, users’ checking behavior is not well aligned with the performance of the suggestion algorithm, resulting in a decrease of typing speed. These findings have implications for the design of intelligent text entry systems and AI support in general, and our WS-Gaze dataset will support future research in this important direction. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""3"",""9"","""",""Proc.

Each participant completed EMA surveys (one smartphone prompt/hour for 96 days in 4-day bursts) and µEMA surveys (four smartwatch prompts/hour for the 270 days). Using data from 177 participants (1.37 million µEMA and 14.9K EMA surveys), we compared engagement across three groups: those who completed 12 months of EMA data collection(Completed), those who voluntarily withdrew after six months of EMA data collection (Withdrew), and those unenrolled by staff after six months of poor EMA response rates (Unenrolled). Compared to EMA, unenrolled participants were 2.25 times, those who withdrew were 1.65 times, and completed participants were 1.53 times more likely to answer µEMA prompts (p < 0.001). Regardless of response rates, µEMA was perceived as less burdensome than EMA (p < 0.001).

This paper presents the Empathic Design Thinking Framework (EDTF), a structured methodology tailored to digital educational game creation. Rooted in human–computer interaction (HCI) principles, the EDTF integrates continuous co-design and iterative user research from ideation to deployment, involving both learners and instructors throughout all phases; it positions empathic design (ED) principles as an important component of HCI, focusing not only on identifying user needs but also on understanding users’ lived experiences, motivations, and frustrations. Developed through design science research, the EDTF offers step-by-step guidance, comprised of 10 steps, that reduces uncertainty for novice and experienced designers, developers, and HCI experts alike. The framework was validated in two robust phases. First, it was evaluated by 60 instructional game experts, including designers, developers, and HCI professionals, using an adapted questionnaire covering dimensions like clarity, problem-solving, consistency, and innovation, as well as standardized scales such as UMUX-Lite for perceived ease of use and usefulness and SUS for perceived usability. This was followed by in-depth interviews with 18 experts to understand the feasibility and conceptualization of EDTF applicability. The strong validation results highlight the framework’s potential to guide the design and development of educational games that take into account HCI principles and are usable, efficient, and impactful. © 2025 by the authors."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""9"",""16"","""",""Information"",""EDTF"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)"","""","""","""","""",""design science research; digital educational games; digital serious games; Empathic Design Thinking Framework; human–computer interaction; serious game design framework; usability testing; user experience; user-centered design"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Integrating cultural semantics into interactive rehabilitation design offers new opportunities to enhance user engagement and emotional resonance in digital rehabilitation therapy, especially in a deeper way rather than visually. This study introduces a framework comprising a “Rehabilitation Mechanism–Interaction Design–Cultural Feature” triadic mapping model and a structured procedure. Following the framework, a hand function rehabilitation game is designed based on Chinese string puppetry, as well body rehabilitation games based on shadow puppetry and Tai Chi. The hand rehabilitation game utilizes Leap Motion for its gesture-based input and Unity3D for real-time visual feedback and task execution. Functional training gestures such as grasping, wrist rotation, and pinching are mapped to culturally meaningful puppet actions within the game. Through task-oriented engagement and narrative immersion, the design improves cognitive accessibility, emotional motivation, and sustained participation. Evaluations are conducted from rehabilitation professionals and target users. The results demonstrate that the system is promising in integrating motor function training with emotional engagement, validating the feasibility of the proposed triadic mapping framework in rehabilitation game design.

In contrast, the dynamic nature of virtual reality (VR) environments establishes virtual museums as a more potent space for both layout optimization and narrative construction, particularly when integrating visitors’ diverse preferences to optimize the virtual museum and convey narratives. Therefore, we first collaborated with experienced curators to conduct a formative study to understand the workflow of curation and summarize the museum narratives that weave exhibits, galleries, and museum architecture into a compelling story. We then proposed a museum spatial layout framework that clarified three narrative levels (exhibit level, gallery level, and architecture level) to support the controllable spatial layout of the museum's elements. Based on that, we developed VirtuNarrator, a proof-of-concept prototype designed to assist visitors in choosing different narrative themes, filtering exhibits, creating and adjusting galleries, and freely connecting them.

Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched six academic databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Compendex, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink), resulting in 1,944 articles. After applying the inclusion criteria, we identified 20 studies for in-depth analysis. Methods ranged from experimental to participatory design, with inclusive strategies such as caregiver involvement, visual aids, and personalized supports frequently reported. Technologies identified included computers and web platforms, mobile applications, AAC systems, smart home tools, and social robots, supporting areas like daily living, communication, learning, navigation, and health. Reported benefits included increased independence and digital inclusion, enhanced communication, expanded social connection, greater confidence and engagement, and enhanced skill development. Common challenges included interface complexity, lack of context-aware interaction, environmental and sensory constraints, and uneven impact across users. Based on these findings and paper analysis, we outline five design recommendations: reduce interaction complexity, support engagement through feedback and flexible pacing, enable personalization and long-term adaptability, provide accessible pathways to secure system access, and embed technology within everyday routines.

MarCHIr automatically compiles web prototypes and analyses them at the pixel level to assess designs using foundational Gestalt visual principles. While computer science student assessments are often personalised with permutations of numbers, we use random assignment of colours to personalise creative prototype assignments at the scale of hundreds of students. Finally, MarCHIr integrates industry accessibility checks to HCI student assessment.

However, it is well understood that users’ behavior varies according to their abilities in processing information, making inferences, and interacting with computing systems. As a result, researchers may miss opportunities to design ranking models that are optimized for their users’ cognitive abilities. To address this, we report an approach for search result re-ranking that incorporates cognitive ability information in the ranking model. We report extensive empirical in-the-wild experiments with data from simulated tasks and real-world tasks of 20 participants to measure, predict, and use these data to train search result re-ranking models. Our results demonstrate that cognitive ability data significantly improve the effectiveness of re-ranking models in simulated-task and real-world conditions, and that cognitive abilities can be predicted from regular user interactions without requiring separate cognitive testing for each user. In particular, the models show improved performance in predicting the position of the documents the users select during search sessions. Our findings show that search engines have significant potential to improve their ranking performance by accounting for users’ cognitive ability. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""",""5"",""43"","""",""ACM Trans.

Although extensive research has explored gaze-based interaction over the past three decades, a systematic framework that fully captures the diversity of gaze interaction techniques is still lacking. To address this gap, we present a novel two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies gaze interactions by (1) the type of input, distinguishing between gaze-only and gaze-assisted modalities, and (2) the type of target, differentiating between those requiring absolute gaze coordinates and thus higher accuracy, and those using relative coordinates, which tolerate lower accuracy. Our taxonomy explicitly captures the required input accuracy and interface constraints of each technique, providing clearer guidance for designers of gaze-based interfaces. We apply this taxonomy to review and classify 125 studies of active gaze interactions on 2D displays.

We conducted a gesture elicitation study, detailing the systematic process of soliciting and refining a custom set of user-defined ring-based finger gestures through participatory design and ergonomic considerations, including thinking time, goodness of fit, and memorization. Subsequently, we delve into the technical underpinnings of gesture recognition.

This work can become challenging when users have an evolving profiles in degenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). The needs of the users at the start of the process may no longer be the same at the end when the system is validated. As consequence, it is important to integrate users in different stages of the disease in the whole process. The involvement of stakeholders (such as healthcare professionals, family members and caregivers) is also crucial for the better understanding of the user's needs and their evolving profile. This article presents how we deal with the evolving user profile in the development of a communication aid software for people with Parkinson's disease. To that end, we have customized the ISO 9241-210 human-centred process with a series of human-computer studies from a broad to a more focused goal. It presents this process and the complementary studies carried out with 97 people with Parkinson's disease, 5 relatives/caregivers and 5 health professionals. In light of the insights gained from this experience, we have formulated several recommendations for human-centred design in the context of a user with an evolving profile. These recommendations outline a human-centred approach to guide the development of software applications for users with evolving profiles.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

These tests were carried out under heterogeneous experimental conditions, making the results non-comparable from one source to another, and calling for a consistent assessment that ensures reproducibility of the results. When a new gesture set should be incorporated in a gesture-based user interface and/or when a new recognizer is made available, this gesture set needs to be tested with existing and new recognizers to determine which recognizer offers the best performance in a given context of use. To this end, this technical note presents Gester, a software that automates the performance testing of stroke gesture recognizers in terms of accuracy (through three recognition rates) and speed (through four execution times). It exports data for visualizing confusion matrices and confusion wheels. We elaborate on typical use cases supported by Gester, which include the two traditional testing procedures, i.e., user-dependent and user-independent scenarios, and provide two new ones, i.e., dataset-dependent and dataset-independent, to test the performance of recognizers under new conditions.

Commonly, these approaches look at how audio-visual feedback based on physiological indicators can help induce a state of meditation. Haptic feedback is now seen as a promising alternative to audio-visual stimuli for meditation. However, as yet, little work has investigated how to personalize haptic feedback or how to combine it with other feedback modalities, notably audio-visual stimuli. In collaboration with a cognitive neuroscience laboratory, we investigated interactions between users and a haptic meditation device through three design research studies. Preparatory evaluations with 20 participants showed a preference for digital over analog interfaces for parameterization of the haptic meditation device. Based on these preliminary results, we developed a digital interface based on three scenarios of use. Extensive evaluations with 29 participants revealed high usability and aesthetic scores while highlighting different perceived user experience qualities. The final study with 21 participants found that the hedonic and pragmatic preferences depend on both the experience of a user and their age.

This research presents a novel approach to provide a framework for quantifying an heuristic evaluation based on the calculus of what we called Usability Percentage. We have used an initial study that started in 2018 with 7 different evaluators and we presented a new methodology to calculate the aforementioned percentage and also provide multiple information that might be added into a final report. We have used the platform RUXAILAB that allows us to create heuristic evaluations to prepare and execute the test. Our findings are that by comparing both studies the new methodology presents a narrowed data distribution through the different evaluators and allows us to identify in a more precise and concise way which heuristics might fail in an evaluation test. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""",""92"","""",""Comput Stand Interfaces"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Elsevier B.V."","""","""","""","""",""Heuristic evaluation; Human–computer interaction; Usability; User experience; Websites"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Paper-based assessments are frequently converted into digital formats for efficiency gains, with little thought given to their user experience (UX) and usability. Individual differences, particularly among young children, can inhibit test-takers from completing the assessment tasks that are not designed to match their needs and abilities. Consequently, studies have raised concerns about the generalizability and fairness of e-assessments. Whereas heuristic evaluation is a standard method for evaluating and enhancing the efficacy of a product with respect to a set of guidelines, more information is needed about its added value when designing e-assessments for children. This paper synthesizes heuristics on the basis of the literature and expert judgments to accommodate children's abilities for interacting with e-assessment platforms. We present a final set of 10 heuristics, validated and refined by applying a heuristic evaluation workshop and collecting 24 expert surveys. The results indicate that the derived heuristics can help evaluate the UX and usability-related aspects of e-assessments with 6- to 12-year-old children. Moreover, the present paper proposes recommendations for a framework for developing usability/UX heuristics that can be used to help researchers develop domain-specific heuristics in the future. © 2024"",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""",""92"","""",""Comput Stand Interfaces"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Elsevier B.V."","""","""","""","""",""Children; E-Assessment; Heuristic evaluation; Usability; User experience"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Affective design principles are essential in developing functional, emotionally resonant, and engaging products for users. Therefore, this study aims (i) to develop an interactive mobile learning application tailored for visually impaired children based on affective design principles and (ii) to validate the application through comprehensive user experience testing by utilizing a hypothetical dataset and heatmap overlay. Employing iterative triangulation methodology (ITM), the study demonstrates that integrating affective design principles significantly enhances the usability and engagement of mobile learning applications for visually impaired children.

They have been adopted in various fields and are gradually becoming part of our lives. UX is a key quality attribute to evaluate or model such experiences. However, when it comes to immersive experiences, evaluating UX is particularly challenging because the user should not be interrupted to provide feedback. Aiming at giving a step to address this issue, we have explored using ontologies from an ontology network to support evaluating immersive experiences. In this work, we adopted the Human-Computer Interaction Ontology Network (HCI-ON) and used an extract containing concepts from some of its networked ontologies to develop the User eXperience evaluation based on Ontology Network (UXON), an ontology-based tool that supports UX experts evaluating immersive experiences based on data recorded in interaction logs. HCI-ON is a framework for organizing knowledge of the HCI domain, offering a general understanding of the field, regardless of specific solutions. UXON was used to evaluate the UX of Compomus, an immersive application that supports collaborative music composition. UXON extracts data from the application interaction logs, calculates UX metrics, and provides consolidated data and information in graphs and tables. We conducted a study and collected feedback from the UXON developer and three UX experts who used the tool. Results showed that using networked ontologies to develop a tool to support UX evaluation is feasible and valuable. In summary, the ontologies helped at the conceptual level by offering a basis to define the system’s structural model and at the implementation level by assigning semantics to data to make inferences about UX. Based on the UX experts’ perceptions, UXON was considered a promising system, beneficial, helpful, and easy to use. The conceptualization used to develop UXON was evaluated by HCI experts and it was considered adequate and understandable, having the potential to be used by other people to solve HCI evaluation problems. © 2025, Brazilian Computing Society.

However, most prior studies on M-Gov usability rely on top-down evaluation methods, such as heuristic assessments or standardized frameworks (e.g., ISO, SUS), which often miss the complex, context-sensitive nature of M-Gov user interaction. This study addresses this gap by adopting a bottom-up, user-centered approach to identify usability issues that arise during actual use of the M-Gov service. Usability data was collected through think-aloud protocols, post-task reflections, and post-study questionnaires. Inductive thematic analysis revealed eight interrelated usability themes, each composed of sub-themes that captured specific issues, resulting in a total of sixteen sub-themes. The core usability issues are: Task Flow Disruptions, Navigation Difficulties, Content Issues, Performance Issues, Support Limitations, Ineffective Error Feedback, Interface Design Issues, Accessibility Barriers. This approach shows how usability challenges emerge and escalate during service interactions. The findings reveal gaps in user behavior alignment, clear communication, and accessibility, especially for older users or people with limited digital skills. The study contributes to M-Gov usability research by offering a structured taxonomy of observed usability failures and extends current evaluation practices by offering a behaviorally grounded view of usability in M-Gov apps and informing more inclusive and reliable digital service design. © 2025 The Authors."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""",""169352-169366"","""","""",""13"","""",""IEEE Access"",""Uncovering Usability Issues in Mobile Government Applications"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""","""","""","""",""design; human–computer interaction (HCI); mobile applications; mobile government (M-Gov); qualitative analysis; think-aloud protocol; Usability; user experience (UX); user testing; user-centered design"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

The results reveal that although digital representations of nature hold potential for raising environmental awareness and supporting education as an alternative to traditional zoos, technological innovation alone is not sufficient. The digital zoo displayed major shortcomings in visual resolution, multisensory integration, interaction, and spatial design. Furthermore, mismatches with user expectations, lack of age-appropriate content delivery, and physical accessibility issues negatively affected the overall experience.

This review aims to establish the groundwork for utilising HDTs in Long-Distance Relationships (LDRs) to enrich the quality of human connections over geographical separations. Searching from four academic databases, this paper examines current DT research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and synthesises existing LDR solutions across commercial and research realms, including communication technologies, social media platforms, wearable and tangible interfaces, Extended Reality (XR) and immersive telepresence, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based companions. The findings reveal significant gaps in the research of broad DTs in HCI communities and highlight the limitations of current LDR solutions. To address these challenges, this study envisions HDTs encompassing both microscopic (individual) and macroscopic (dyadic) dimensions, offering a novel approach to enhancing emotional and experiential closeness despite geographical separation. Several potential scenarios for HDT integration in LDRs are presented, demonstrating its capability to enhance LDR interactions. © 2025 The Author(s).

They also play a critical role in human–computer interaction (HCI). Comprehending hand gestures is crucial to ensuring that listeners grasp the message speakers are trying to convey. Despite the extensive application of convolutional neural network (CNN) methods in hand gesture recognition, optimizing hyperparameters remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches for setting CNN parameters often rely on trial-and-error adjustments, which are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposed a hybrid algorithm by combining the Improved Rat Swarm Optimizer (IRSO) algorithm with CNN to optimize the hyperparameter configuration of a predetermined CNN. A novel custom-digit dataset was collected to recognize 280 dynamic gestures representing Malaysian Sign Language signs. The results demonstrate that the IRSO–CNN method provided superior performance compared to other alternative methods. Specifically, IRSO–CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.98% with a loss rate of 0.04, surpassing standard RSO–CNN with an accuracy of 0.97% and a loss rate of 0.06, PSO–CNN with an accuracy of 0.96% and a loss rate of 0.09, and ABC–CNN with an accuracy of 0.94% and a loss rate of 0.18. Future work involves expanding hyperparameter optimization and implementing IRSO for real-time sign recognition in assistive communication tools. Copyright © 2025 Zinah Raad Saeed et al.

In this competitive scenario, User eXperience (UX) has emerged as an essential factor in standing out from competitors. By understanding what factors affect UX, practitioners could focus on factors that lead to positive UX while mitigating those that affect UX negatively. In this context, app store reviews emerged as a valuable resource for investigating these influential factors. However, analyzing millions of reviews can be costly and time-consuming. This article introduces UX-MAPPER, a tool designed to analyze app store reviews and assist practitioners in pinpointing factors that impact UX. We applied the Design Science Research method to develop UX-MAPPER iteratively and rooted in a robust theoretical background. We performed exploratory studies to investigate the problem, a systematic mapping study to identify UX-affecting factors, and an empirical study to ascertain practitioners’ relevance and acceptance of UX-MAPPER. In general, the participants recognized the relevance and utility of UX-MAPPER in enhancing the quality of existing apps and exploring reviews of competing apps to identify user preferences, requests, and critiques regarding functionalities and features. However, the output quality requires refinement to better convey the benefits of the results, especially for practitioners with prior experience with automated approaches. From the participants’ feedback, we defined a set of suggestions to extract more useful features, which can contribute to future studies involving user review analysis. Based on the results of this research, we present the contributions to the area of HCI and possible developments for future research. © 2025, Brazilian Computing Society.

Motivated by the ubiquitous challenges our world is facing, this initiative had the goal to explore six main issues from an interdisciplinary perspective with a focus on the UN SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities” and the HCI Grand Challenge 2 “Human-Environment Interactions.” The six issues were formulated as questions and presented to the participants working in small groups. (1) How to create inclusive and ethical smart cities? (2) How to establish trust between people and smart environments? (3) How to address privacy concerns in smart environments that adopt the “disappearing computer” paradigm? (4) How to promote explainability and transparency of policies and measures to citizens of smart cities or in smart environments in general? (5) How to design incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior in smart cities at a personal as well as collective/corporate level? (6) How to measure success and impact in sustainable smart city projects? The method and approach of the Design Café is a tailored composition of a guided, structured format combined with and inspired by processes of informal communication and exchange of knowledge and ideas. Aligned moderation, a minimum set of rules, a set of relevant topics and an interdisciplinary group of motivated participants working in rotating formations provides the structure for achieving results. The results show that the six issues are not independent of each other, but require a holistic view, considering the various dependencies as well as synergies when exploring solutions. Nevertheless, the importance of first establishing higher-level goals based on ethical and inclusive approaches fostering human dignity and human rights were key. Acceptance of overall goals, processes, rules, and regulations was considered as the fundamental pre-requisite for sustainable change towards a declared goal. Acceptance needs trust and privacy as well as explainability and transparency of policies and measures. The role of incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior was twofold. Offering incentives must include planning on how to measure their impact. Effec"	tive measurement of success and impact depends heavily on how the institutions address privac	y.

Data synthesis can address this by generating artificial datasets that mirror real-world data. In this paper, we propose AppGen, an autoregressive generative model designed to generate app usage behavior based on users' mobility trajectories, improving dataset accessibility and quality. Specifically, AppGen employs a probabilistic diffusion model to simulate the stochastic nature of app usage behavior. By utilizing an autoregressive structure, AppGen effectively captures the intricate sequential relationships between different app usage events. Additionally, AppGen leverages latent encoding to extract semantic features from spatio-temporal points, guiding behavior generation. These key designs ensure the generated behaviors are contextually relevant and faithfully represent users' environments and past interactions. Experiments with two real-world datasets show that AppGen outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 12% in critical metrics and accurately reflects real-world spatio-temporal patterns. We also test the generated datasets in applications, demonstrating their suitability for downstream tasks by maintaining algorithm accuracy and order.  © 2002-2012 IEEE."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""IEEE Trans.

Usability plays an important role in user experience and directly influences users’ satisfaction and overall perception of the IT solution. A combination of subjective and objective evaluation methods can increase the overall usability assessment. Methods: This paper presents a comparative analysis of eye-tracking and survey data that provided a comparison of the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of three popular operating systems (OSs), Linux, macOS, and Windows, in terms of usability, efficiency, and overall user experience. The study was conducted on a group of over sixty participants using eye-tracking technology and System Usability Scale (SUS) surveys. Several metrics were applied based on features related to eye tracking and task completion. Raw data, including fixations and saccades, was used to generate scan paths and heat maps, enabling objective measurement of respondents’ aggregated attention intensity and gaze patterns. Results: The results revealed particular usability issues that significantly confuse users or make the system difficult to use. Although Linux and macOS differ significantly in interface design and functionality, these objective distinctions were not reflected in users’ mean subjective assessments. Median score analysis suggests that Windows and Linux were rated similarly, while macOS consistently ranked lower. Conversely, in objective performance measures, Linux demonstrated the poorest outcomes, whereas Windows performed best in perceived usability. The results suggest that users rely on familiar interaction patterns and spatial memory, which may explain inconsistencies linked to prior experience with Windows. In detailed primary OS-specific analysis, Linux and macOS demonstrate relatively stable outcomes, whereas Windows shows greater variability. © 2025 The Authors."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""",""169236-169261"","""","""",""13"","""",""IEEE Access"",""The Force of Habit"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""English"","""","""","""","""",""Scopus"","""",""Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."","""","""","""","""",""Eye tracking; graphical window managers; operating systems GUIs; SUS; usability; user experience"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

Integrating speech into single-player games with non-player characters (NPCs) introduces a new social dimension. Yet, like toxicity in social media and multiplayer games, anti-social behavior can infiltrate NPC interactions, generating a toxic gaming atmosphere. We designed a speech-based game called “A Day at the Office” and conducted a within-subject study with 26 participants to explore player interactions with NPCs possessing different human qualities. Furthermore, we introduced courtesy-based game mechanics, where NPCs react to players’ choice of words and loudness, investigating player experiences. Results revealed that participants spoke differently with NPCs based on their human qualities, such as gender and hierarchical roles.

The overhead of employing head-mounted devices is decreased in camera-based systems by using the web camera as the mouse. The research problems and opportunities are tracking the user's facial expression of various users with various head poses through the camera and accurately converting into mouse cursor movement and click events. The usual GUI interactive features like menus and scroll bars that need horizontal or vertical movement are difficult to operate on the existing systems since they can only move the cursor in a slanting manner. Unintentional head movements by users frequently result in the current system losing track of facial feature tracking. The proposed system uses a standard web camera to capture the three-dimensional head rotation. To shift the mouse pointer vertically, the positions of the nasal bridge and nose tip are collected. The inner corners of the left and right eyes, as well as the tip of the nose, are also used to shift the mouse cursor horizontally. Unintentional head motions are disregarded to prevent the loss of face features, and by using fuzzy logic, the movement of the mouse pointer is only mapped with the intended head movements. The fuzzy control uses the head's rate, direction, and distance as inputs to determine how the mouse pointer will travel. By capturing the stable, purposeful, and sudden movements of the head, respectively, the fuzzy system classifies the movement of the head as weak, fair, or powerful. By removing the weak and strong head motions, the algorithm just maps the fair head movements with cursor movement on the screen. The proposed system has achieved the horizontal and vertical movement of the cursor and the results are significant when compared with the existing system. The system also successfully ignores the slight movement of the head captured by the web camera when the user remains the head stable, and the feature loss is completely avoided. © 2025 Slovene Society Informatika.

However, the relationship between 3D spatial attributes of visual stimuli and visual attention is still underexplored. Thus, we design an experiment to collect a gaze dataset in VR, and use it to quantitatively model the probability of first attention between two stimuli. First, we construct the dataset by presenting subjects with a synthetic VR scene containing varying spatial configurations of two spheres. Second, we formulate their selective attention based on a probability model that takes as input two view-specific stimuli attributes: their eccentricities in the field of view and their sizes as visual angles. Third, we train two models using our gaze dataset to predict the probability distribution of a user’s preferences of visual stimuli within the scene. We evaluate our method by comparing model performance across two challenging synthetic scenes in VR. Our application case study demonstrates that VR designers can utilize our models for attention prediction in two-foreground-object scenarios, which are common when designing 3D content for storytelling or scene guidance.

This study addresses that gap by analyzing over 100,000 user reviews of AI-related products from G2.com. Based on widely adopted industry guidelines, we identify seven core HAI dimensions and examine their coverage and sentiment. We find that the sentiment on four HAI dimensions–adaptability, customization, error recovery, and privacy–is positively associated with user satisfaction. However, engagement with HAI dimensions varies by professional background: Users with technical job roles are more likely to discuss system-focused aspects, such as reliability, while non-technical users emphasize interaction-focused features like customization and feedback. Interestingly, job role does not moderate the link between HAI sentiment and satisfaction, indicating that once a dimension is identified, its effect is consistent across roles. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Int.

This study employs a comprehensive multimethodological approach combining systematic literature review, regulatory gap analysis, and ethical framework synthesis. Our methodology integrates qualitative analysis of primary sources, comparative assessment of international legal frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, EU,AI Act), and development of a five pillar ethical framework validated through real-world case studies across educational, commercial, and healthcare Metaverse applications. Building on these insights, we propose an ethical framework emphasizing transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy by design, and user autonomy. We then examine practical solutions such as blockchain-based identity management, privacy tools, regulatory sandboxes, and global standards harmonization. Through computational simulation of representative Metaverse environments, we explore how stakeholders can apply these guidelines to balance innovation with user protection. Finally, we explore future directions, including integrating brain computer interfaces (BCIs), emotion detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, and international governance models. Validation through case study analysis demonstrates significant improvements in privacy protection metrics, substantial reduction in identity theft vulnerabilities, and marked enhancement in user autonomy controls compared to existing frameworks.

The analysis resulted in six main themes describing the user experience of older PwMs: emotional reaction to self-monitoring of health, behavioural reaction to self-monitoring of health, involvement from PwMs’ social network in self-monitoring of health, PwMs’ health literacy, PwMs’ self-efficacy in health management, and PwMs’ technology acceptance for self-management. Based on distinctive differences in these themes and the analytical lens of the Causality Orientations Theory, four user types were distinguished: the Independently Empowered, the Socially Activated, the “Not for me”, and the Ruminator. By exploring these different user types and their needs regarding digital self-management, we have provided a first step for researchers and health practitioners towards enhanced personalised support that enables the optimal self-management journey of older adults with multimorbidity. © The Author(s) 2025."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""J.

This study combines participatory design and usability testing to assess the user experiences of touchless interaction methods for smart glasses in the context of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The participatory design workshops with 16 EMS providers reveal a preference for touchless interaction methods such as voice commands and pinch hand gestures, driven by the need to keep hands free and minimize cross-contamination risk. Despite this preference, the laboratory-based usability testing with 16 EMS providers indicates that both voice commands and hand gestures fall short in task performance compared to the default tangible buttons on smart glasses, primarily due to software limitations and EMS providers’ unfamiliarity with touchless techniques. Our findings reveal specific issues associated with using different interaction methods when operating smart glasses. Building on these insights, we discuss design implications for smart glasses to better align with the dynamic and unique characteristics of fast-paced medical work. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""",""2984-3003"","""",""5"",""41"","""",""Int.

However, selecting a cover image and writing the text for product promotion could be challenging, especially for novices in this occupation. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach, with the best model’s accuracy of 0.775, to assess whether viewers will click on the beauty product post in RED based on the content, color, and texture features of its cover image. With this model, we develop BeautyClicker to support drafts of beauty product promotion posts. A within-subjects study with novices (N = 32) and interviews with four beauty influencers demonstrate that BeautyClicker helps select cover images and improves the quality of posts. Lastly, we discuss insights into modeling viewers’ click intent and supporting the creation of social media posts. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."",""2025"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"",""2025-11-23 13:48:00"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""Int.
